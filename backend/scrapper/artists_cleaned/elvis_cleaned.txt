


Well, since my baby left me
Well, I found a new place to dwell
Well, it's down at the end of Lonely Street
At Heartbreak Hotel


Where I'll be, I'll be so lonely, baby
I'll be so lonely
I'll be so lonely, I could die

Well, the bellhop's tears keep flowin'
And the desk clerk's dressed in black
Well, they've been so long on Lonely Street
They'll never, never look back


They get so lonely, baby
They get so lonely
They get so lonely, they could die




You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Sniffin' at my door
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time
Well, you ain't never caught a rabbit
You ain't no friend of mine, no




Well, it's one for the money, two for the show
Three to get ready, now go, cat, go

Hey baby, I ain't asking much of you
No no no no no no no no baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do


Don't be a stingy little mama
You're 'bout to starve me half to death
Now you can spare a kiss or two and
Still have plenty left, no no no
Baby, I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do

But I ain't greedy, baby
All I want is all you got, no no no
I ain't asking much of you
Just a big-a big-a big-a hunk of love will do

You know I'd have all of the things my lucky charms could bring
If you give me just a one sweet kiss
Oh no no no no no no no no

When a boy like me meets a girl like you
Then I must believe wishes come true
I just look at you and I touch your hand
And this ordinary world becomes a wonderland


There are many girls I have met before
But I passed them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment
One to last a lifetime through
When a boy like me meets a girl like you

There are many girls I have met before
But I passed them by because I knew
There would be this magic moment
One to last a lifetime through
When a boy like me meets a girl like you
When a boy like me meets a girl like youCowboy, cowboy marry me
I'll bake you a cherry pie
Well thank you very kindly mam
But I'm too young to die

Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collar

Cowboy if you'll marry me
I'll be your darling Jenny
Now why should I drink from just one well
When I can drink from twen'y

Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collar

Cowboy, cowboy name the day

Gladly meet you at the church
July the 32nd

Hi-lo-do-si-dosy-do
Stay single and save a dollar
Come Saturday night I'll court a pretty girl
With a cane and a high starched collar

Now Adam and evil, they go hand in hand
Eve taught him sin, that's the way it all began
But every time you kiss me, my heart pounds like a drum
So if trouble is a woman, trouble here I come


I'm lonely like Adam, you're evil like Eve
I shouldn't take forbidden fruit 'cause I believe
I'll be heading straight for heartache
I should cut loose and run
But if loving you means heartache
Heartache, here I come


You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight


And even if you're evil, baby hold me tight
You're not the angel that I dreamed about
But you're the devil I don't want to live without
A woman's a woman, a man is a man
I can't be free I'm just putty in your hands
Who cares about tomorrow, I need your love tonight

If I had my life to live over
I know just what I'd like to be
A pampered pet of a rich brunette
Sitting on my mama's knee
Someone to love me, someone to care
Rub-a-dub dubble little fingers through my hair


I need a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
That's good enough for me

If I had a bone to be picking
I'd be picking chicken or a steak
Curled up there in an easy chair
Man, that won't be hard to take
I'll always be faithful, that's what I'd be
Never bite a hand that feeds me, no siree




I'd find me a pink little poodle
And lose my noodle over her
I chase her around all over town
Just to ruffle up her fur
Nuzzle her muzzle, a holding her paw
Greatest case of puppy loving you ever saw


It's called a dog's life
What a life, that's good enough for me
You heard me say it now
That's good enough for me
That's good enough for me
But now after loving you
What else is there to do 
For honey, all the rest
Is just gonna have to be second best
I know I'll go through life
Comparing her to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you


Your precious love cannot be erased
By just another woman with a pretty face
And your memory, you know it will remain
For it cannot be erased
Other loves may come along
They can't live up to you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you

I said I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
After loving you
I said I'm no good
I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone
To anyone, to anyone, to anyone
After loving you
That's cause I'm no good
I'm no good to anyone after loving you
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart
I give You my heart


So take my heart
And my whole life too
For I can't help fallin' in love with You
Take my heart
Take my whole life too
For I can't help fallin' in love with You
Oh, take my heart
Take my whole life too, Lord
For I can't help fallin' in love with You, yeah
And so take my heart
Take my whole life too
Oh, 'caus  I can't help fallin' in love with You
Oh, for I can't help fallin' in lov  with You

I can't help 
No, I can't 
I can't help fallin' in love with You
No, I can't help fallin' in love with You
I can't help fallin' in love with You
I can't help fallin' in love with
I can't stop bein' in love with You
I can see you now living like a queen
In a house that has everything, everything but love
Crystal chandeliers, chauffeured limousines
Yes you'll really have everything, everything but love


I see diamonds and sables, sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
I see diamonds, sables, sapphires and pearls
And as the picture clears
Poor little rich girl sitting all alone
Counting her treasures in tears
Better just a shack where two people care
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
Than a house that has everything, everything but love
Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now


I'll never forget sweetheart the night you told me
That you couldn't live without my love somehow
That's all in the past I knew it wouldn't last
But I won't care a hundred years from now

Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now




Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from now




Well a hundred years from now I won't be crying
A hundred years from now I won't be blue
My heart will have to forget that we ever met
But I won't care a hundred years from nowI could ride around the world in an old oxcart
And never let another girl thrill my heart


Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you so 

I could meet a hundred girls and have loads of fun
My hugging and my kissing belong to just one



If you gave me nine lives like an alley cat
I'd give them all to you and never take one back



I'm putting on my Sunday suit and I'm going downtown
But I'll be kissing your lips before the sun goes down




Ain't that loving you baby 
Ain't that loving you so Ouais
Mon amour vient de partir
Je sais o  je vais mourir
Au fond d'une rue aux murs mouill s
A l'h tel des c urs bris s

Et je serai si seul, mon vieux
Et je serai si seul
Oh ! Je serai si seul
  en mourir
Ouais
Des larmes du groom coulent sans cesse
Le portier est tout en noir
Car ils sont rest s dans la d tresse
On ne pourra plus jamais les revoir

Et ils se sentent si seuls, mon vieux
Ouais, ils se sentent si seuls
Oh, ils se sentent si seuls
Qu'ils pourraient mourir

Ouais
L'h tel est toujours complet
Mais je sais qu'il y a une place
Pour ceux qui ont le c ur bris 
Par un amour d chir 

Et ils se sentent si seuls, mon vieux
Ouais, ils se sentent si seuls
Ils se sentent si seuls
A en mourir

Ouais
Si ton amour va partir
Que tu choisis de mourir
Va dans la rue aux murs mouill s
A l'h tel des c urs bris s

Now that the truth is hard to face
I can't forget you once were mine
Someone else is in my place
Whenever we meet my heart beats out of time


Just a little bit of green
Clouds my eyes to what I've seen
Just a little bit of green
When I see you with someone new
And knowing that there's nothing I can do

Please don't try to tie me down
Those are the words you often say
I can't help seeing you around
You smile with surprise, I turn my eyes away

All en el rancho grande
All donde vva
Habl una rancherita
Que alegre me deca
Que alegre me deca:
"Te voy hacer unas calzones
Comos los que esa el ranchero
Los comenzo de lana
Y los acabo de hierro."
There in the great ranch
There where she used to live
There used to be a cowgirl
Who joyfully used to tell me
Who joyfully used to tell me
"I'm going to make some trousers
Like those which the cowboy wears
I'm starting them with wool
And I'm finishing them with iron."
Hello, misfortune, how's my old friend "Mr. Misery" 
I've been away so long
I bet you thought you'd seen the last of me


I got no bed to rest my head
No doors or walls or window pane
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain

Met a little honey
At the Buzzing Bumble Bee Cafe, yes, I did
One drink and all my money
And that honey bee had flown away


I'm 'bout as low as I can go
I don't really mean to complain
Now all I needed was the rain
Rain, rain, rain, rain


All I needed was this rain
All I needed was the rain

All that I am or ever hope to be
Lies in your hands
You are my destiny
When you are in my arms, I rule the world
And when we're far apart, how cruel the world


All that I want is to be near to you
To spend my life making it clear to you
You are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
All that I am, I am because of you
All that I want is to be near to you
To spend my life making it clear to you
You are my heart, my soul, my dream come true
All that I am, I am because of you



Because of you
Because of you
We almost shared a dream
We almost made it as a team
How nice it would have been


We almost touched the stars
And there stood heaven, almost ours
But we were just outsiders looking in
We had the chance to fall
But fate stepped in to end it all
Before it could begin


And if it's true, you're really going
There's nothing but goodbye to say
The saddest part of all is knowing
We almost went all the way
I was always, baby, I was always
Well, almost always true to you
Met a pretty mademoiselle
Her papa owned a small hotel
Oh, I was almost always true to you
I resisted, though my arm was twisted
I was almost always true to you
I stayed away from drinking wine
Thought about you all the time
Oh, I was almost always true to you

Kept refusing, don't jump to conclusions
I was almost always true to you
I would never grab like this
I would never steal a kiss
Oh, I was almost always true to you
I was almost always true to you
Your lips were made for kisses so tender
I'm almost in love tonight
When we are close, my heart says surrender
I'm almost in love tonight


And here under the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight


It may be just the spell of evening
I long to hold you tight
Heaven is near, why think of tomorrow
I'm almost in love tonight


Almost in love
Aloha  oe, aloha  oe
E ke onaona noho i ka lipo
One fond embrace
A ho i a e au
Until we meet again
Until we meet again
'Til we meet againRain was your birth
Gathered deep
Beneath the earth
Search and seep
Hollow stone
Issue and flow
Virgin stream
Meander free
It's a long way to the sea
Caves and canyons
Stark prison walls
Swirl and hurl you


Glory, glory hallelujah
His truth is marching on
His truth is marching on

I just got your letter baby
Too bad you can't come home
I swear I'm going crazy
Sitting here all alone
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues

I ain't slept a wink since Sunday
I can't eat a thing all day
Every day is just blue Monday
Since you've been away
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues

Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rolling down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace


I gotta get myself together
Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train going
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues


Whoops, there goes a teardrop
Rolling down my face
If you cry when you're in love
It sure ain't no disgrace

Before I lose my mind
I'm gonna catch the next train goin'
And leave my blues behind
Since you're gone
I got a mess of blues

Am I ready, can my heart be true 
Am I ready, to fall in love with you
One love, one girl, one dream shared by two
Am I ready, to fall in love with you
I have touched your lips, and now I know
I would be a fool, to let you go


Should I, could I, how I wish I knew
Am I ready, to fall in love with you


Fall in love with you

And I love you so
The people ask me how
How I've lived 'til now
I tell them I don't know


I guess they understand
How lonely life has been
But life began again
The day you took my hand


And yes, I know how lonely life can be
Shadows follow me
And the night won't set me free
But I don't let the evening get me down
Now that you're around me


And you love me too
Your thoughts are just for me
You set my spirits free
I'm happy that you do


The book of life is brief
Once the page is read
All but love is dead
This is my belief

Listen easy, you can hear God calling
Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind


Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we're living is now
Now, now, now, now, now, now, now


Young birds flying, and the soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
No, the grass won't pay no mind
Listen easy, you can hear God calling
Walking barefoot by the stream
Come on to me, Your hair's softly falling
On my face as in a dream
And the time will be our time
And the grass won t pay no mind


Saying nothing, lying where the sun is
Baking down upon our sides
My lips touch you, with their soft wet kisses
Your hands gentle in reply
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind

Child, touch my soul with your cries
And the music will know what we've found
I, hear a hundred good-byes
But today I hear only one sound
The moment we re living is now
Now now now now now now now


Young bird flying, and a soft wind blowing
Cools the sweat inside my palms
Close my eyes, hear the flowers growing
As you lay sleeping in my arms
And the time will be our time
And the grass won't pay no mind
No the grass won't pay no mind
If I have wounded any soul today
If I have caused one's foot to go astray
If I have walked in my own willful way
Dear Lord for-give


For-give the sins I have confessed to Thee
For-give the secret sins I do not see
Oh guide watch over me and my keeper be
Dear Lord, a-a-men, a-a-men
Angel, with those angel eyes
Come and take this earth boy
Up to paradise

Angel, may I hold you tight 
Never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight


If I said, "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn 
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn
Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven
Here on earth with you


Angel, never kissed an angel
Let me kiss one tonight


If I said, "I love you"
Would I be speaking out of turn 
I'm only human, but I'm willing to learn

Angel, make my wish come true
Let me be in heaven
Here on earth with you

Angel
Angel
Don't ever take your eyes off me
Not even for a minute
'Cause like a panther I might pounce
And there'll be danger in it


I can be sneaky, fast as a snake
I strike like a cobra, make no mistake
And baby, you'll be trapped, quick as a wink
It's animal instinct


Don't think that I won't pin you down
No matter how you plead it
I'm like a lion who's been caged
And you're the meat I'm needin'


Watch out, I'll warn you, sharp as a hawk
I'm wild as a tiger, I prowl, and I stalk
Because when a man feels thirst, he takes a drink
It's animal instinct


You better not be caught off guard
This wolf is on the search now
A leopard just can't change its spots
And I'm about to lurch now
Love's like the jungle, I fight tooth and nail
I just gotta get you, you'll fall without fail
I'm ready for the kill, I'm right on the brink
It's animal instinct
It's animal instinct, animal instinct
Any day now I will hear you say
Goodbye my love
You'll be on your way
Then my wild beautiful bird
You will have flown


Any day now

I'll be all alone



Any day now, when your restless eyes
Meet someone new, to my sad surprise
Then the blue shadow will fall all over town


Any day now

Love will let me down



I know I shouldn't want to keep you
If you don't want to stay, yeah
Until you've gone forever
I'll be holding on for dear life

Anyone could fall in love with you
Anyone who knows you as I do
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling


Anyone could lose his heart like me
Anyone who has eyes that can see
Anyone could fall in love like me
And I love you my darling


You're the star I reached for
You're a dream so rare
You're my greatest treasure
Nothing can compare


Anyone could want you for his own
Anyone not only mine alone
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Anyone could fall in love with you
And I love you my darling
Whether I'm riding down a highway
Or walking down a street
It makes no difference, baby doll
Wherever we chance to meet

Each time I hold your little hand
It makes me feel so very nice
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you

Whether we're standing on a doorstep
Or sitting at a park
Or strolling down a shady lane
Or dancing in the dark

Where I can take you in my arms
And look into your pretty eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you


Give me a cave up in the mountains
Or a shack down by the sea
And I will be in heaven, honey
If you are there with me

Where I can kiss your pretty lips
See the love light in your eyes
Anyplace is paradise
When I'm with you


Baby, I'd live deep in the jungle
And sleep up in a tree
And let the rest of the world go by
If you were there with me

I memorize the note you sent
Go all the places that we went
I seem to search the whole day through
For anything that's part of you


I kept a ribbon from your hair
A breath of perfume lingers there
It helps to cheer me when I'm blue
Anything that's part of you


Oh, how it hurts to miss you so
When I know you don't love me anymore
To go on needing you
Knowing you don't need me


No reason left for me to live
What can I take, what can I give
When I'd give all of someone new
For anything that's part of you
I'll be as strong as a mountain
Or weak as a willow tree
Any  way you want me
Well, that's how I will be


I'll be as tame as a baby
Or wild as the raging sea
Any way you want me
Well, that's how I will be


In your hands my heart is clay
To take and hold as you may
I'm what you make me, you've only to take me
And in your arms I will stay


I'll be a fool or a wise man
My darling, you hold the key
Yes, any way you want me
Well, that's how I will be
I will be
Are you lonesome tonight  Do you miss me tonight 
Are you sorry we drifted apart 
Does your memory stray to a brighter summer day
When I kissed you and called you sweetheart 


Do the chairs in your parlor seem empty and bare 
Do you gaze at your doorstep and picture me there 
Is your heart filled with pain  Shall I come back again 
Tell me, dear, are you lonesome tonight 


I wonder if you are lonesome tonight
You know someone said that the world's a stage and each must play a part
Fate had me playing in love with you as my sweetheart
Act one was where we met
I loved you at first glance
You read your lines so cleverly and never missed a cue
Then came act two
You seemed to change, you acted strange
And why, I've never known
Honey, you lied when you said you loved me
And I had no cause to doubt you
But I'd rather go on hearing your lies
Than to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there
With emptiness all around
And if you won't come back to me
Then they can bring the curtain down
Before the evening is over I will have made a complete and total fool of myself, and I hope you get a kick out of watching it. One of my first records that I made--I mean, that I recorded--back in 1927, I think it was. Went like this:

I wonder if you're lonesome tonight
You know, someone said the world's a stage, and each of us play a part
Playin' m-pl-, ' pla-plllllll, plus tax
You read your line so le-cleverly, ha ha, you never missed a cue
You came back to, and forgot the words, and seen the chang , you fool
You're actin' strange, and why, I nev r know... why I ever did it
Honey, who am I talking to  You lied when you said you loved me
You s- I had no cause to doubt you
When I think what- rrrrr-really go on hearing your lies
Then to go on living without you
Now the stage is bare and I'm standing there without any hair, I dunno
If you don't come back to me, ...aw, the heck with it

Is your heart filled pain  Can I come back again 
Tell me dear, are you lonesome tonight 
Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Are you sincere when you say you love me too


And are you really mine every day, all the time
I've gotta know which way to go
Will our love grow, are you sincere


Are you sincere when you say "I love you"
Honey, are you sincere when you say you love me too

Ask me if I wanted to caress you
And I'd confess
Ask me if I'm longing to possess you
I'll answer yes


Now that we're together
I could hold you close forever
And I swear that I would never let you go

There's no question that I care more than you
Love me darling, just be mine completely
And there's nothing I won't do if you
Just ask me
Let the stars fade and fall
And I won't care at all
As long as I have you
Every kiss brings a thrill
And I know that it will
As long as I have you


Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you

Let's think of the future
Forget the past
You're not my first love
But you're my last
Take the love that I bring
Then I'll have everything
As long as I have you


As long, as long as I have you
Ooh, love, a thing called love


Six foot six he stood on the ground, he weighed 235 pounds
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love
He was the kind of a man who would gamble on luck
Look you in the eye and never back up
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love


You can't see it with your eyes, hold it in your hands
But like the wind it covers our land
Strong enough to rule the heart of many man, this thing called love
It can lift you up, never let you down
Take your world and turn it all around
Ever since time nothing's ever been found that's stronger than love




Most men are like me they struggle and doubt
Trouble their minds day in and day out
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love
But when I see a mother's tenderness
As she holds her young close to her breast
Then I thank God that the world's been blessed
With a thing called love

*Whistling*


Did you ever notice when the sun goes down
Out of nowhere comes a strange and pretty sound


*Whistling*


It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
If you listen you can hear it in the breeze
Specially when the breeze is drifting through the trees


*Whistling*


It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
And the murmuring waters sing the song
The echoing mountains hum along
The whispering valleys fill the air
With a whistling tune our hearts can share


It's so wonderful to walk beneath the moon
Listening to old mother nature's favorite tune
It's a whistling tune for walking in the night
You kiss me, darling, a miracle starts
A magic feeling comes into our hearts
The spell of love began when we're alone
And we're in a world of our own

You say you want me, and music I hear
Touch me, my darling, and clouds disappear
The sky is bright above, and cares have flown
And we're in a world of our own

Holding you close is heaven
Only I know what it's worth
Knowing you're mine forever
Is the greatest wonder on earth
Nothing can change it, the magic's begun
When we're together, our hearts become one
I find a happiness I've never known
When we're in a world of our own

When we're in a world of our own
I'll send you red roses by the dozen
I'll call you sweet little things like turtle dove
I'll whisper pretty things in your ear
The kind of things a girl likes to hear
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love


I'll bring you pounds and pounds of chocolate candy
To prove it's you that I've been thinking of
Tear up all the pictures I own of every pretty girl I've ever known
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love


I'll take you dancing every night until you're ready to drop
I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop
Every night I'll serenade you 'neath your window
If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can
It ain't going to be no one-night stand
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love


I'll take you dancing every night until you're ready to drop
I'll kiss your sweet red cherry lips until you holler stop
Every night I'll serenade you  neath your window
If you need me just a whistle and I won't need a shove
I'll hug you squeeze you tight as I can
It ain't going to be no one-night stand
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
Baby, if you'll give me all of your love
If you will give me, if you will give me all your love

Baby baby baby
Come back, baby, I wanna play house with you


Well, you may go to college
You may go to school
You may have a pink Cadillac
But don't you be nobody's fool


Now baby
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you


Now listen and I'll tell you baby
What I'm talking about
Come on back to me, little girl
So we can play some house


Now baby
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby, come
Come back, baby
I wanna play house with you
Oh let's play house, baby

We're going up, we're going down
We're going up, down, down, up
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh, baby, what you want me to do


You got me peeping, you got me hiding
You got me peep, hide, hide, peep
Any way you wanna let it roll
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You got me doin' what you want me
Oh, baby, what you want me to do
I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down-home country song
Because when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong


Give me a honk-tonk fiddle with a guitar in the middle and a melody
Humming like a fountain swinging out on Smokey Mountain


I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down-home country song
Because when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong


Now the big toe's connected to the two toes
And the two toes connected to the three toe
And the three toe's connected to the four toe
And the four toes connected to the five toe
And the five toe and away we go


I want a barefoot ballad yes a barefoot ballad
Won't you play for me a down-home country song
Because when I kick my shoes off and I kick my blues off
With a barefoot ballad, you just can't go wrong

I'm a poor Hawaiian beach boy
A long way from the beach
'Cause someone shoved his face against my hand
Now I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can


I was minding my own business
Drinking daddy's juice
I swear I'll never touch that stuff again
Just like a pig before he gave his all at the lu'au
I'm in the pen

Got those beach boy blues
Don't the time go slow
Lonely beach boy blues
Only 30 days and 90 years to go


I want a taste of honey
From my wahine's lips
I want to be her ever loving man
But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can


But I'm a kissing cousin to a ripe pineapple
I'm in the can
When you're through swimming
I'll dry your back
Come and relax, girl
In my little beach shack
You believe me now
Dum-di-dum-di-dum, yeah-yeah-yeah
There'll be nothing you'll lack
It's a pleasure to welcome you
To my little beach shack


In my beach shack, baby, we'll be alone
In my beach shack, I'll make you feel at home


Take off that wet cap
Let down your hair
Come to my beach shack
You'll be comfortable there
Dum-di-dum-di-dum, yeah-yeah-yeah
Be my guest, have a snack
See how nice I treat company
In my little beach shack



Because of love, I'm a hundred feet tall
I can bounce this world like a little old ball
Well, heaven and earth are now all mine
I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
Because, because, because, because of love


Because of love, I'm a mighty big man
I hold the sun in the palm of my hand
Just one leap I can cross the seas
Jump over mountains and fly over trees
Because, because, because, because of love



Well, I found love, I found love
At all that I can say
Oh, I'll never, never, I'll never, never
Never let it get away


Because of love, I'm the happiest guy
And life is sweet as cherry cream pie
Well, heaven and earth are now all mine
I've jumped to the moon from cloud number nine
Because, because, because, because of love
Because, because, because, because of love
First time I fell in love
I fell in love with you
First time I dared to dream
My only dream came true


Must be beginner's luck
To wish upon a star
That opened up my eyes
And there you are


I wave no magic wand
I own no lucky charms
How then can I explain
An angel in my arms
Must be beginner's luck
What else can it be
When someone wonderful as you
Loves me
Breeze, sing a happy song
This heart of mine is singing right along
Don't know where I'm going, don't know where it ends
Feel the grass is greener beyond the bend

I haven't got a care
I'm just on my way to anywhere
Pocketful of nothing, nothing I can spend
Hope the grass is greener beyond the bend


Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me

So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend

Beyond the bend, perhaps there'll be
Somebody waiting who's right for me

So I got to move around
And I know I've got to cover ground
Oh, the trip is shorter when you got a friend
Gonna find that rainbow beyond the bend
Beyond the reef where the sea is dark and cold
My love has gone from me and my dreams grow cold
There'll be no tears, there'll be no regretting
Will she remember me, will she forget 

I'll send a thousand flowers
Where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so
Some day I know, she'll come back again to me
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef

I'll send a thousand flowers
Where the trade winds blow
I'll send my lonely heart for I love her so
Some day I know, she'll come back again to me
Till then my heart will be beyond the reef

And a house built for two, ain't a home
When it's lived in by one, one lonely one
And I can no longer hear footsteps
Come right down the hall

Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall


She caught me lying
Then she caught a train
And I caught a fever
Walking home in the rain, oh yeah

But it's over and I'm done
She left me once and for all


Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fall
Here come the teardrops
Bitter they are, harder they fallEvery man has a black star

Blessed Jesus, hold my hand ...
Oh, yes, I need Thee every hour
Through the this pilgrims land
Protect me by thy saving power
Please, hear my feeble plea
Oh, hoh, Lord, please, tell me
I kneel in prayer, I try to meet you there
Blessed Jesus, hold my hand, hold my handHow many roads must a man walk down
Before you call him a man 
Yes and how many seas must a white dove sail
Before she sleeps in the sand 
Yes and how many times must cannonballs fly
Before they're forever banned 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many times must a man look up
Before he can see the sky 
How many ears must one man have
Before he can hear people cry 
How many deaths will it take till he knows
That too many people have died 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind

How many years can a mountain exist
Before it's washed to the seas 
How many years can some people exist
Before they're allowed to be free 
How many times can a man turn his head
Pretend that he just doesn't see 
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind
The answer is blowin' in the wind
I found my thrill on Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill when I found you
The moon stood still on Blueberry Hill
It lingered until my dreams came true


The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be


Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill


The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be


Though we're apart, you're part of me still
For you were my thrill on Blueberry Hill
I'll have a blue Christmas without you

I'll be so blue just thinking about you


Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree

Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me



And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'

That's when those blue memories start callin'


You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas
I'll have a Blue Christmas without you
I'll be so blue just thinking about you
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree
Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start falling
That's when those blue memories start calling
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue blue blue Christmas

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas
In the twilight glow I see her
Blue eyes crying in the rain
When we kissed goodbye and parted
I knew we'd never meet again


Love is like a dying ember
Only memories remain
Through the ages I remember
Blue eyes crying in the rain

Someday when we meet up yonder
We'll stroll hand in hand again
In a land that knows no parting
Blue eyes crying in the rain


Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Blue eyes crying in the rain
Night and you
And blue Hawaii
The night is heavenly
And you are heaven to me


Lovely you
And blue Hawaii
With all this loveliness
There should be love

Come with me
While the moon is on the sea
The night is young
And so are we, so are we


Dreams come true
In blue Hawaii
And mine could all come true
This magic night of nights with you
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own


Blue moon
You knew just what I was there for
You heard me saying a prayer for
Someone I really could care for

Without a love of my own


Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart
Without a love of my own


Without a love of my own

Blue river, it can't be found on any map that I know
But it's the place where lonely lovers all go
To cry their tears, blue river
It winds along a path of heartache and pain
Of broken dreams from loving someone in vain
Like I loved you, and baby I still do
I held you so tight


You were out of my sight

Well children by and by when the morning comes
All the saints of God together they come
We will tell the story how the Lord will come
And we'll understand him better by and by


Trials dark on every hand and we cannot understand
All the ways God will lead us
To the blessed promised land
He will guide us with his eye
And we'll follow till we die
And we'll understand him better by and by




Temptation's hidden snares often take us unaware
And our hearts are made to bleed
For some thoughtless word or deed
And we wonder why the test when we try to do our best
But we'll understand it better by and by




And we'll understand him better by and by

For I can't help falling in love with you
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Now the show you're gonna see is strictly high class
There'll be ten hula dancers shaking their grass
So step right up and put your money down
This way to Carny Town


We got a man so skinny you can see his bones
We play on his ribs like a xylophone
With a pair of spoons we get a rockin' song
You'll hear it all in Carny Town

Hurry, hurry, hurry, the house is almost full
We got a two headed cow, and that's no bull
There's a man who swallows swords, and he never gets hurt
He eats razor blades for dessert
He's just about the sharpest guy around
You'll see him here in Carny Town


Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Aha-ha hurry, hurry, step this way
Aha-ha I say we're gonna win
I said hurry up
Sweet Caroline, how great thou art
Wear my ring around your neck
With a big hunk of love
Don't be cruel, you gotta treat me nice
I just can't help believin'
I got suspicious minds


Well, such a night it is
You're the devil in disguise
Who am I, it's midnight, I'm leaving
Rubberneckin', I've got a thing about you, babe
A hundred years from now, roll on


Sweet Caroline, one night with you
At Heartbreak Motel
We'll make the world go away
If you talk in your sleep, it ain't no big thing
We can make the morning
The impossible dream


Well, such a night it is
You're the devil in disguise
Who am I, it's midnight, I'm leaving
Rubberneckin', I've got a thing about you, babe
A hundred years from now, roll on

Won't you show me how to kiss 
Put your lips on mine
Do you do it just like this 
Tell me I'm doing fine
We got a good thing going, now take your time
Come on and make it last
Love may be new to you, but, ooh
I'm catching on fast


Give, give, give me all you've got to give
Love, love, love every moment you live
Now you've taught me all you know
Have I passed the test 
Show me all you've got to show
Baby, you're the best

But tell me I've learned quickly, and I know each trick
I'm sure love's going to last
Love maybe new to you, but, oooh
I'm catching on fastThe cattle are prowlin' and the coyotes are howlin'
Way out where the dogies bawl
Where spurs are a-jinglin' a cowboy is singin'
This lonesome cattle call

Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo

He rides in the sun, till his days work is done
And he rounds up the cattle each fall
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Singin' his cattle call

For hours he will ride on the range far and wide
When the night wind blows up a squall
His heart is a feather in all kinds of weather
He sings his cattle call

Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo hoo
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo

He's brown as a berry from ridin' the prairie
And sings with an ol' western drawl
Woo-hoo woo-hoo hoo hoo

If you're in old habits
Set in your old ways
Changes are a-coming
For these are changing days


And if your head is in the sand
While things are going on
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

Now if you're in the habit
To let your temper fly
When you talk with people
Who don't see eye to eye


And if you don't believe it
There's a newer world ahead
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit


A change of habit, a change of outlook
A change of heart, you'll be alright
The halls of darkness, have doors that open
It's never too late to see the light


So if you're in the habit
Putting people down
Just because they're different
From the wrong side of town


Well, don't count on any medals, son
They're pinning none on you
What you need, what you need
What you need is a change of habit

With eyes that hide the man within
You see behind the eyes of, other men
You've lived and died and come to life again
And now you stand alone at the crossroads of your mind
You've left your yesterdays behind..
But which road leads you to tomorrow 
Charro


You've turned your back on yesterday
Betrayed a man who swore he'd make you pay
For when you left you took his pride away
You know he'll never let you break away so easily
You'll have to fight, before you're free
But how much more time can you borrow 
Charro

Now in a single moment your past grows dim
One thought goes racing across your mind
You ride to meet the woman you stole from him
Oh no!, Charro don't go!
Charro don't go!!


There's something hanging, in the wind
Your past is catching up and closing in
You've been halfway to hell and back again
And now you laugh in the devil's face
With your last breath
You'll run a race with life and death
But will you live to see tomorrow 
Charro
What's in the drink, chase the Devil away
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Trouble is my middle name
Though it's such a crying shame
Try and try there's nothing I can do
But I'm feeling kinda strange
Feel like things are going to change

Time my lucky star was shining through
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way


Drink a cup of gypsy love
Just tip it up and then you just say Chesay
Swallow once then swallow twice
Goes down so nice just say Chesay, hey


What's in the drink, chase the Devil away
Magic I think so I just say Chesay
Chesay, Chesay bring you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way


Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Chesay, Chesay brings you good luck night and day
Chesay, Chesay that's the gypsy way
Chesay
I'll have a blue Christmas without you

I'll be so blue just thinking about you

Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree

Won't be the same dear, if you're not here with me

And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'

That's when those blue memories start callin'

You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white

But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas


The mistletoe's right here
Come give a kiss to Santa Claus


Merry Christmas to all, and all a good night
Huh, now we all livin' the good life
Yeah, though it's forty b low the wind chill
And we wipin' snow up off the windshi ld
It's still wonderful night to be alive, baby
And I'm so happy I'm with my baby
And we a little late with the Christmas gifts
Rushin' for the mall, don't trip, you know I drive crazy
The streets lit up, it feel like Christmas officially
Told her that "You the star at the top of my Christmas tree"
My only question is, "Where my presents "
She said, "Shhh," she got a gift for me that ain't for the kids to see
Well, I like the way you think, mami
Now pour some more eggnog in your drink, mami
You've been a bad girl, give Santa three kisses
Gave her the hot chocolate, she said, "It's Dee-ricious"
Hahahaha, yeah

Thank you for listening. I like to wish you a merry Christmas and a wonderful New Year

Silent night, holy night
All is calm, all is bright
'Round yon Virgin Mother and Child
Holy Infant so tender and mild
Sleep in Heavenly peace
Sleep in Heavenly peace

Silent night, holy night
Shepherds quake at the sight
Glorious streams from Heaven afar
Heavenly host sing Alleluia
Christ the Savior is born
Christ the Savior is born
Wish I was an apple dangling from a tree
Every time you'd pass me by, you'd take a bite of me
I wish I was a bluebird, I'd never fly away
I'd sit up on your shoulder, baby, and sing to you all day


Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home to me

I wrote it in a letter, carved it on a tree
Told it to a honeycomb, told it to a bee
Told them that I love you, they all know it's true
Say it 'til the cows come home, until it gets to you


Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home to me




Need you in the morning to start the coffee pot
Need you in the afternoon to fan me when I'm hot
Need you in the evening when supper time is through
What I'm really trying to say is I can't get enough of you


Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home, Cindy, Cindy
Come on home to me

When shadows beckon on dim-lit avenues
Night people hear the call
From hidden alleys, and secret rendezvous
They come out one and all


The city by night eyes wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake


Whatever sets off the spark
A magic glow lights the dark
Then I'm intrigued by the sight
Of the city by night

Those crowded nightclubs
Those picturesque cafes
Are scenes no-one forgets
And I'm enchanted, music softly plays
By dancing silhouettes


The city by night eyes wide awake
It never sleeps make no mistake

Hey
All right


Clambake, gonna have a clambake
Clambake, gonna have a clambake


Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake
Mamma's little baby loves clambake too
Mamma's little baby loves clambake, clambake
Mamma's little baby loves clambake too


Hey, listen world you've got to know
I'm cutting loose and letting go
Who needs the worry and the strife
Life can be a ball now just following my life



Look for the brightest lights in town
That's where you'll find me hanging round
I've got this feeling to be free
I pick and choose the life I want and that's the life for me

Back porch preacher preaching at me
Acting like he wrote the golden rule
Shaking his fist and speeching at me
Shouting from his soap box like a fool
Come Sunday morning he's lying in bed
With his eye all red, with the wine in his head
Wishing he was dead when he oughta be
Heading for Sunday school


Clean up your own backyard
Oh don't you hand me none of your lines
Clean up your own backyard
You tend to your business, I'll tend to mine


Drugstore cowboy criticizing
Acting like he's better than you and me
Standing on the sidewalk supervising
Telling everybody how they ought to be
Come closing time 'most every night
He locks up tight and out go the lights
And he ducks out of sight and he cheats on his wife
With his employee
None
Come on everybody and snap your fingers now
Come on everybody clap your hands real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving my baby
Loving my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me


Come on everybody and whistle this tune right now
Come on everybody and stomp your feet real loud
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving my baby
Loving my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me

Well there ain't nothing wrong with the long-haired music
Like Brahms, Beethoven and Bach
Well I was raised with a guitar in my hand
And I was born to rock


Well, come on everybody and turn your head to the left
Come on everybody and turn your head to the right
Come on everybody take a real deep breath
And repeat after me
Loving my baby
Loving my baby
Hey, hey, hey and my baby loves me
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight
Spend your money looking at the chorus line
Spend your money, win it on the number 9
Take your sweetheart even though she's never been
If she's worried tell her that you always win
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, you're gonna win a fortune tonight


Hear the whistle, lady luck's about to go
Is she smiling, maybe yes or maybe no
Now's the time when nights are filled with sweet romance
Don't be bashful step on up and take a chance
Come along, come along, there's a full moon shining bright
Come along, come along, we're gonna hit St. Louis tonight

Come along, come along, we're gonna win a fortune tonightI am yours and you are mine, come what may
Love like ours remains divine, come what may
Even though we're miles apart
You're living in my lonely heart
At night the teardrops start and pour the long long day

I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And I'll be here with you come what may
All right!

I keep your picture near me since you went away
I plant a kiss upon your lips each night and day
Bear in mind and you will find a heart that is true
And I'll be here with you come what may
And I'll be here with you come what may
And I'll be here with you come what may
Ah um bop a bop a um bop a bop a come what may
When everyone thought the world was flat
Columbus said "It's round"
He went down in history
And America was found


Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence


With a "C" and an "O" and an "N" and an "F"
And an "I" and a "D" and an "ENCE"
Put them all together and what have you got confidence


You'll be surprised what you can do
If you will only try
Remember the tortoise and the hare
Who had that famous race
The speedy hare wound up nowhere
And slow poke took first place


Cause he had confidence
A little thing called confidence
There's no job too immense when you've got confidence

Sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
To sprinkle you with sand
He'll say, "One, two, three"
And you will be
In cotton candy land

Sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
He'll take you by the hand
And you'll ride upon
A big white swan
In cotton candy land


You and the swan will float upon
A cloud of pink ice cream
Where every star is a candy bar
And the moon is a marshmallow dream


Sandman's comin', yes, he's comin'
Take his magic hand
And now, goodnight... and now sleep tight
In cotton candy land
In cotton candy land
When I was a little baby
My mother would rock me in the cradle
In them old, old cotton fields at home
When I was a little baby
My mother would rock me in the cradle
In them old, old cotton fields at home


Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You couldn't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them old, old cotton fields at home


It may sound a little funny
But, you didn't make very much money
In them old cotton fields at home
It may sound a little funny
But, you didn't make very much money
In them old cotton fields at home


Oh, when them cotton balls get rotten
You couldn't pick very much cotton
In them old cotton fields at home
It was down in Louisiana
Just a mile from Texarkana
In them old cotton fields at home

Could I fall in love for the very first time
That's what I ask myself when you're lips touch mine
Could I fall in love on a night like tonight
That's what I'd like to know when I hold you tight


Now that we're alone 
Just a kiss apart 
I have the answer from the feeling in my heart
Could I fall in love and forever be true
My heart tells me I could if I fell for you
Crawfish
Crawfish


Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear


You give me fever when you kiss me 
Fever when you hold me tight 
Fever in the morning 
Fever all through the night 


Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm going to treat you right


You give me fever when you kiss m  
Fever when you hold m  tight 
Fever in the morning 
Fever all through the night 

Crawfish 
Well, I went to the bayou just last night
There was no moon, but the stars were bright
Put a big long hook on a big long pole
And I pulled Mr. Crawfish out of his hole


Crawfish 
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat, look
Fresh and ready to be cook

Crawfish 
Now take Mr. Crawfish in your hand
He's gonna look good in your frying pan
If you fry him crisp or you boil him right
He'll be sweeter than sugar when you take a bite


Crawfish 
See I got him, see the size
Stripped and cleaned before your eyes
Sweet meat, look
Fresh and ready to be cook
Crawfish 
I can explain about last night
Though things didn't look just right
Please believe me there was nothing wrong
I thought about you baby all night long
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie


Talk about a piece of rotten luck
You do a friend a favor and you wind up stuck
She couldn't hold a candle to you, no siree
Very hard to handle like a model T
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie

Please believe me when I say
Wild horses couldn't drag me away
From you because I don't have to look too hard
To see what I've got in my own back yard
So, please forgive me and forget


Don't say my alloy's all wet
I miss those kisses from your honeycomb
This humble bumble bee just wants to fly back home
Cross my heart, I hope to die
Well, I wouldn't tell you no lie


I wouldn't tell you no lie
No, no, no, no, no, no
I wouldn't tell you no lie
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I'm happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day


I've searched  and I've searched 
But I couldn't find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind

Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord 
Yes, we gather in the chapel
Just to sing and praise the Lord


You'll search  and you'll search 
But you'll never find
No way on earth to gain
Peace of mind


Take your troubles to the chapel
Get down on your knees and pray 
Then your burdens will be lighter
And you'll surely find the way 
You saw me crying in the chapel
The tears I shed were tears of joy
I know the meaning of contentment
Now I am happy with the Lord
Just a plain and simple chapel
Where humble people go to pray
I pray the Lord that I'll grow stronger
As I live from day to day

But I couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind


Now I'm happy in the chapel
Where people are of one accord
We gath r in the chapel
Just to sing and praise th  Lord


You'll searched and you'll searched
But you couldn't find
No way on earth
To gain peace of mind
Girls in kimonos, shy little flowers
Smiling from beneath their parasols
Dainty little moonbeams, delicate as china
Gentle little oriental dolls



My name should be trouble
My name should be woe
For trouble and heartache
Is all that I know
But Danny, yes, Danny is my name



My life has been empty
My heart has been torn
It must have been rainy, oh yes
The night I was born
Oh Danny, oh Danny is my name



I'm so afraid of tomorrow
So tired of today
They say that love is the answer
But love never came my way


I'm writing a letter
To someone, I know
So if you should find it, oh yes
And if you're alone
Oh Danny, yes, Danny is my name


Oh Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling
From glen to glen and down the mountain side
The summer's gone and all the roses dying
'Tis you, 'tis you must go and I must bye


But come ye back when summer's in the meadow
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow
And I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow
Oh Danny boy, oh Danny boy, I love you so


But if he come and all the roses dying
And I am dead, as dead I well may be
He'll come here and find the place where I am lying
And kneel and say an Ave there for me


And I shall feel, oh soft you tread above me
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be
For you will bend and tell me that you love me
And I shall rest in peace until you come to meDark moon, way up high up in the sky
Oh, tell me why, oh tell me why
You've lost your splendor
Dark moon, what is the cause your life withdraws
Is it because, is it because I've lost my love

Mortals have dreams of love's perfect schemes
But they don't realize, their love can sometimes bring the
Dark moon, way up high up in the sky

Dating is a game that grownups play
Dating means acting in a silly way
Dating makes girls start wiggle walking
Dating makes a guy start baby talking

Dizzy like children on a merry-go-round
Grownups are the biggest kids I've found


You'd think they belonged in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
Cause some day you'll be dating too

Dating makes a guy comb his hair just right
His girl can mess it up when they kiss good-night
Dating makes you quarrel and say you'll break up
And just because it's so much fun to make up

Children can't wait to grow up but then
They're dating and they're acting like kids again


You'd think they belonged in a baby carriage
They're doing things that lead to marriage
But don't you laugh at what they do, oh no
Some day you'll be dating too

I've got a dirty, dirty feelin'
Dirty dealings goin' on
You know I almost hit the ceilin'
When I woke up and you were gone


I took you in when you were hungry
And now you're cuttin' out on me
I'm gonna help you, little darlin'
That ain't the way it's gonna be

I hear you're pretty good at runnin'
But pretty soon you'll slip and fall
That's when I'll drag you home with me, girl
I'm gonna chain you to the wall 



You know I'm lookin' for you, baby
I ain't gonna take it layin' down
I heard that you were cookin', baby
Way on the other side of town


I've got a dirty, dirty feelin'
Dirty dealings goin' on
You know I almost hit the ceilin'
When I woke up, and you were gone 
Well, down in New Orleans at the Golden Goose
I grabbed a green-eyed dolly that was on the loose
Well, I dig that music, well she said, "Me too"
I said, "Pretty baby come on and let's do"


The Dixieland rock 
Well, the Dixieland rock 
Let your hair down Sugar, shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me

With the blue light shining on her swinging hips
She got the drummer so nervous that he lost his sticks
The cornet player hit a note that's flat
The trombone hit him while the poor cat sat


To the Dixieland rock 
Well, the Dixieland rock 
Let your hair down Sugar, shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me


I was all pooped out and when the clock struck four
But she said, no daddy can't leave the floor
She wore a clinging dress that fit so tight
She couldn't sit down so we danced all night


To the Dixieland rock 
Well, the Dixieland rock 
Let your hair down Sugar, shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me

Let your hair dance Sugar, shake it free
And do the Dixieland rock with me


I gave my heart
I gave my love
Oh ho, my darling
I am true
Doing the best
The best I can 
But it's not good
Enough for you


I tried so hard
So hard to please
Oh ho, my darling
What more can I do
Doing the best
The best I can 
But it's not good
Enough for you 

You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all


I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
Oh ho, my darling
My whole life through
Doing the best
The best I can 
But it's not good
Enough for you 


You know I was the kind who'd run
Any time you'd call
I guess I was the only one
Who didn't mind at all


I'll be a dreamer
I'll be a fool
Oh ho, my darling
My whole life through
Doing the best
The best I can 
But it's not good
Enough for you 
Dominick, Dominick, why are you stallin'
Don't you hear love callin' to you
Moo, moo, move your little fadeaux

Dominick, Dominick, pick one then take 'er
There's acres and acres to choose
Oh, oh, only a fool would refuse

I, I, If I had your trouble
Life would be double good sweet
There'd be no grass growin' under my feet

Listen Dominick, Dominick, when will you hunger
You ain't gettin' younger my friend
Love, love, love 'em all right to the end

I, I, I can't understand you, leavin' them beauties forlorn
It's time to take the old bull by the horn
Come on Dominick, Dominick, they're itchin' and twitchin'
Better start pickin' some woo
Moo, moo, move your little fadeaux!
I've been yearnin' for a little romance
I want to know when you're gonna give me a chance
Love me honey, tell me you're mine
Doncha' think it's time

I've been yearning for a sweet embrace
Rub my hair till I'm a total disgrace
Kiss me honey make me feel so fine
Doncha' think it's time

I don't wanna walk without you
Walking right by my side
It hurts me to see you talkin'
With the other guy


I get so warm when you touch my cheek
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak
Love me honey, when you feel so fine
Doncha' think it's time


I don't wanna walk without you
Walking right by my side
It hurts me to see you talkin'
To any other guy


I get so warm when you touch my cheek
You thrill me so much that I can hardly speak
Kiss me honey, make me feel so fine
Doncha' think it's time
Doncha' think it's time
Doncha' think it's time
Doncha' think it's time
Let's take the phone off the hook
Turn the lights way down low
Baby put down that book
Tell the maid to go


Do not disturb
Hang the sign on the door
Do not disturb
It's time to make love
And I can't wait anymore

I'll just pull down the blind
Now come over here
I've got one thing in mind
Let's get comfortable dear




Everything's right tonight
Mmmm, it's great when we kiss
Now your arms hold me tight
Let's stay like this
Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't


Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't don't

If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay

Baby, don't say don't
Don't please don't
I'll go on loving you 
Don't ask me why 
Don't know what else to do
Don't ask me why


How sad my heart would be 
If you should go 
Though you're not good for me
I want you so


It's not the kind
Of love, I dream about
But it's the kind
That I can't live without


You're all I'm longing for 
Don't say goodbye 
I need you more and more
Don't ask me why
I need you more and more

Today I stumbled from my bed
With thunder crashing in my head
My pillow still wet
From last night tears
And as I think of giving up
A voice inside my coffee-cup
Kept crying out, ringing in my ears
Don't cry daddy
Daddy, please don't cry
Daddy, you've still got me and little Tommy
Together we'll find a brand new mommy
Daddy, daddy, please laugh again
Daddy ride us on your back again
Oh, daddy, please don't cry
Why are children always first
To feel the pain and hurt the worst
It's true, but somehow
It just don't seem right
Cause every time I cry I know
It hurts my little children so
I wonder will it be the same tonight
We're caught in a trap
I can't walk out
Because I love you too much, baby
Why can't you see
What you're doin' to me
When you don't believe a word I say 


We can't go on together
With suspicious minds 
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds


So if an old friend I know
Stops by to say hello
Would I still see suspicion in your eyes 
But here we go again
Askin' where I've been
You can't see the tears are real, I'm cryin'


We can't go on together
With suspicious minds 
And we can't build our dreams
On suspicious minds

Don't leave me now 
Now that I need you 
How blue and lonely I'd be
If you should say we're through 


Don't break my heart 
This heart that loves you 
There'd just be nothing for me
If you should leave me now 

What good is dreaming
If I must dream all alone by myself
Without you, darling  
My arms would gather dust
Like a book on a shelf


Come to these arms 
These arms that need you 
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't leave me now 
Don't close your eyes to my plea
Don't you leave me now 
Don't, don't, that's what you say
Each time that I hold you this way
When I feel like this and I want to kiss you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't


Don't, don't leave my embrace
For here in my arms is your place
When the night grows cold and I want to hold you
Baby, don't say don't
Don't don't don't

If you think that this is just a game
I'm playing
If you think that I don't mean
Every word I'm saying
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't feel that way
I'm your love and yours I will stay


This you can believe
I will never leave you
Heaven knows I won't
Baby, don't say don't
Don't please don'tYou needn't sit and wonder why, babe
It don't matter anyhow
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Look out, look out your window, baby, I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm travellin' on
Yeah, don't think twice, it's all right

I'm headed down that long lonesome road, girl
Where I'm bound I can't tell
Goodbye is too good a word, girl
I'll just say, "Fare thee well"
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind
You could have done better but I, I don't mind
You just sorta wasted my precious time
Ooh, don't think twice, it's all right

Take it home

When the rooster crows at the break of dawn
Well, look out your window, baby, I'll be gone
You're the reason I'm movin' on
Yeah, don't think twice, it's all right

Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, girl
It don't matter anyhow
Ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe
If you don't know by now

Hey everybody gather round
And listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're going to shake the beach


Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze
Dig right in and do the Clam


You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
The moon ain't going to last all night
Let's work up an appetite




Everybody's got that beat
Well, listen to those happy feet
Ain't you glad that you found out
What the Clam is all about
Hey, everybody, gather 'round
Listen to that bongo sound
Grab the first one in your reach
Now we're gonna shake the beach

Do the Clam, do the Clam
Grab your barefoot baby by the hand
Turn and tease, hug and squeeze
Dig right in and do the Clam

You can get your heart to spin
On the outside looking in
Moon ain't gonna last all night
Let's work up an appetite

Do the Clambake, we're gonna have a clambake
Clambake, gonna have a clambake

Look for the brightest lights in town
That's where you'll find me hangin' 'round
I'v  got this feeling to be free
I'll pick and choose the lif  I want and that's the life for me

Clambake, gonna have a clambake
Clambake, gonna have a clambake, hey!

Do the Vega take a chance and do the Vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets you and then I'll bet you
You'll shake like a sun of a gun


First you make the right connection
Choose the one who's your selection
Though you risk your reputation
You'll increase your circulation



Roll and keep your shoulders busy
Like a wheel spin 'till you're dizzy
Kick your heels when you've a notion
Shake and shimmy that's the motion




Do the Vega take a chance and do the Vega
If you dance it you'll have fun
The fever gets you and then I'll bet you
You'll shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Shake like the sun of a gun
Some guys fall in love with one girl, I got to fall for two
There's just so much loving that one heart's supposed to do
So I go around with my heart dragging on the ground
Dogging me around, I'm the sorriest sight in town


I got double trouble, I got double trouble
I got double trouble twice as much as anybody else, oh yeah


I guess there's got to be two dark clouds hanging over me
My future looks a bumpy as a matchbox on the sea
Every time I think that I have finally got it made
Some losing cards are played, I just can't make the grade

Let's snap our fingers, clap our hands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Let's give 'em what the song demands
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside
We'll hear them playing, keep that beat
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside, down by the riverside
Let's get together, what a treat
Down by the riverside, down by the riverside

Strike up the band. Start the parade
Don't let that grand old rhythm fade
Just play that song, play that number
When the saints come marching in
Shake tambourines. Play that cornet
That trumpet horn you won't forget
Your heart will hum to that number
When the saints come marching in

The cymbals clang. Just pound that beat
Sounds like a hundred marching feet

It's fun to join in that number
When the saints come marching in
See banners wave. Oh hear that ring
We all feel prouder than a king
'cos everyone, everyone loves that number
When the saints come marching in
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane
Janie, Janie, Janie, Janie, Jane Jane


Down in the alley, just you and me
We're going bowling till half past three
Just rocking and reeling, we'll get that feeling
Down in the alley, oh baby Gee


I plant you now and dig you later
'Cause you're a fine sweet potato
We'll have a ball and that ain't all
Down in the alley, just you and me


The clock is striking a mournful sound
This time of evening my love comes down
That's when I'm missing your kind of kissing
Down in the alley, that's where I'll be
Alright, oh


Down in the alley, we sure have fun
We just get started 'bout half past one
So if you're 'round just come on down
Down in the alley and you will see

Do you know who I am 
Have you had any idea who I am 
Yes, it's been quite a while
And it's so good to see you again


It's so dark in this place
That I can't see your face
May we leave 
Oh I see
Does he know who I am
And what once was between you and me 


Do you know how I tried 
Have you any idea how I tried
Not to keep you inside
Do you know darling how much I cried 

I remember you said
That you had to forget about me, and be free
Do you know who I am or have you forgot about me 


Do you think there's a chance
You and I could start over anew
Is there a prayer you still care
Or has it just been too long and we're through 
Well, what about you and him 
Oh he's only a friend
Well I see there's still a chance for me

Drums of the islands, you're beating in my heart
You're with me no matter where I roam
If ever I wander, if ever we're apart
I know that you will lead me home


If I should journey across the deep blue sea
I'll never forget these coral shores
Drums of the islands, I hear you calling me
And I'll return forever yours

I love each valley, each grain of sand, each hill
The flowers, the music of the isles
These are the things I love and always will
Though I may roam ten thousand miles
In the early mornin' rain
With a dollar in my hand
And an achin' in my heart
And my pockets full of sand
I'm a long ways from home
And I miss my loved ones so
In the early mornin' rain
With no place to go


Out on runway number nine
Big 707 set to go
But I'm out here on the grass
Where the pavement never grows
Where the liquor tasted good
And the women all were fast
There she goes my friend
She's rollin' out at last


Hear the mighty engines roar 
See the silver wing on high 
She's away and westward bound
Far above the clouds she'll fly
Where the mornin' rain don't fall
And the sun always shines
She'll be flyin' over my home
In about three hours time
Earth Angel, Earth Angel
Will you be mine
My darling dear
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you

Earth Angel, Earth Angel
The one I adore
Love you forever and ever more
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
I fell for you
And I knew
The vision of your lov-loveliness
I hoped and I prayed that someday
That I'd be the vision of your hap-happiness

Oh,Oh
Earth Angel, Earth Angel
Please be mine
My darling dear
Love you all the time
I'm just a fool
A fool in love with you
Earth boy dream of angel
Angel she be sweet
And make him have happy heart in land of love
Angel dream of earth boy
Earth boy who'll be true
And love her till sun grow cold in land of love


Angel walk on street 
Earth boy walking too 
All at once they meet
 Dreams come true

Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me



All at once they meet
 Dreams come true

Now best part of story
Like two doves in land of love we will always be
Happy angel is you
Happy earth boy is me

Easy come, easy go
Here, there, everywhere
Crazy love is in the air
Nightfall, mm, day and nightfall

So many girls in every port
You got to be a juggernaut
Full speed ahead or you'll be caught
Oh yeah, oh yeah


Easy come, easy go
Up, down, all around, kiss and kiss
And pound for pound, delicious
Mm, so nutritious


Sailor beware take it slow
Easy come, easy go, all right


When you want love to keep you warm
There's nothing like a uniform
You got a port in any storm
There she blows
Do you or don't you love me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Tell me, will you or won't you need me
Such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer

All you do is give a sigh
And beat around the bush
Can it be that you're too shy
To give yourself a little old push
Can you or can't you tell me yes
It's such an easy question
Why can't I get an answer
Though you are gone, I still wear your ring
They're playing the song we used to sing
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past


The letters you wrote I treasure them so
And I hear your voice wherever I go
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Are coming to me out of the past

In the rustle of a breeze; in the patter of the rain
In the rushing of the seas, all I hear is your name
Come back my love and once you are near
Darling I know no more will I hear
Echoes of love, echoes of love
Because you'll be with me right in my heart


Echoes of love, echoes of love
Cause you'll be with me right in my heart
I walk along a thin line, darling
Dark shadows follow me
Here's where life's dream lies disillusioned
The edge of reality


Oh, I can hear strange voices echo
Laughing with mockery
The border line of doom I'm facing
The edge of reality

On the edge of reality, she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless name
On the edge of reality, where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain


She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If she's not real, then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality


On the edge of reality, she sits there tormenting me
The girl with the nameless name
On the edge of reality, where she overpowers me
With fears that I can't explain


She drove me to the point of madness
The brink of misery
If she's not real, then I'm condemned to
The edge of reality


 Reality
 Reality
 Reality...
The edge of reality, reality
Dark shadows follow me
The edge of reality


Better get your head together
See what's going on
Don't waste your time, you're gonna left behind
Better get your head together
See what's going on
Don't waste your time, dark shadows follow me

Do-do, do-do, do, do, do-do, do, do, do-do, do, do
Do-do, do-do, do, do, the edge of reality


I walked along a thin line, darling
Dark shadows follow me
Here's wher  life's dream lies disillusion d
The edge of reality
Reality
Dark shadows follow me
The edge of reality


Better get your head together
See what's going on
Don't waste your time, you're gonna left behind
Better get your head together
See what's going on
Don't waste your time, dark shadows follow me 


Do-do, do-do, do, do, do-do, do, do, do-do, do, do
Do-do, do-do, do, do, the edge of reality



Dark shadows follow me
There's a legend of a famous matador
Who went to meet El Toro
Though he fought as he had never done before
He could not beat, El Toro


The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame


They said time would never heal the many scars
Brought by the great, El Toro
And the bitterness that burned deep in his heart
Caused him to hate, El Toro



So one night, when no-one was in sight
The matador, went to settle the score
In the lonely fields, beneath the pale moonlight
He sought the bull, and they fought once more


When they found the matador, they saw him dying
He'd never see tomorrow
Now they say that on the spot where he was lying
Still walks the proud El Toro


The bull El Toro, brought him defeat and pain
And to his sorrow, the matador knew shame
Well, since my baby left
Well, since my baby left
My baby left
At Heartbreak, Heartbreak, Heartbreak


Mi gira la testa quando arrivi, sembri Elvis
Mi passi davanti, fingi che non mi conosci
Ho sbagliato a dirti: "Ho bisogno di pensare" e adesso, oh, no
Bevo Hennessy, sono io ora a starci male e non mi va neanche un po'
No, non mi va, no, no
Io cambier , per te sar  rock n' roll
Baby, dai, ah, ah, dimmelo che mi vuoi ancora
E ripensavo a noi in quel hotel
A scopare sopra la moquette
Paglie e vetri di bottiglie,  h
Non c'era niente da p rdere
Poi parlare fino alle tre
Di che modi si pu  morire
Che se lo potessi scegliere
Vorrei bruciare nella notte con te


Well, since my baby left
My baby left
Elvis
My baby left
Heartbreak, Heartbreak
Well, since my baby left
My baby left
Elvis
My baby left
Heartbreak, Heartbreak, Heartbreak

Elvis Presley




Yes my baby left me
Never said a word
Was it something I done
Something that she heard 

My baby left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word


Yes I'm standing at my window
Wring my hands and cry
I hate to lose that woman
Hate to say goodbye


You know she left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word


Baby, one of these mornings
Lord, it won't be long
You'll look for me and baby
Daddy will have gone


You know she left me
My baby left me
My baby even left me
Never said a word

Sing End of the Road


I'm not gonna do nothin'. Stop



Well the way is dark
The night is long
I don't care if I never get home
I'm waiting
At the end of the road
Well the stars may not shine
Neither the moon
What the heck we don't want no moon
I'm waiting
At the end of the road
You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas
Pull out the front, don't give me no sass
Take your foot slap it on the floor
When you get ahead we'll rock some more
Oh The way is dark
The night is long
I don't care if I never g t home
I'm waiting
At the end of th  road
You can jump in my Ford and give it some gas
Flip out the front, don't give me no sass
Take your foot slap it on the floor
When you get ahead we'll rock some more
Well the way is dark
The night is long
I don't care if I never get home
I'm waiting
At the end of the roadNone
Everybody come aboard The Showboat tonight

You'll have the best time of your life
Hey everyone let's go, on with the show


Everybody's gonna gamble on The Showboat tonight
The big casino's lit up bright
How can you lose just wear a grin you'll be sure to win
Lady Luck's waiting there inside
The wheel of fortune's about to ride
Hey everyone let's go on with the show


Way down by the levee, the boats at the bank
Bring money to spend your welcome my friend
Just walk up the plank
Everybody come aboard the showboat tonight
Look around at the happy sight
We'll guarantee that you'll have a ball
Come on one and all
Well what a great night you've got in store
You'll wanna keep coming back for more
Hey everyone let's go on with the show

As I read the letters that you wrote to me
Well it's you, it's you that I'm thinking of
As I read the lines that to me were so sweet
I remember our faded love


I miss you darling more and more everyday
As heaven would miss the stars above
With every heartbeat, I still think of you
And remember our faded love


As I think of the past, all the pleasures that we had
As I watch the mating of the doves
It was in the springtime that you said goodbye
I remember our faded love


I'll pack up all my things and walk away
I don't want to hear another word you have to say
I've been waiting for so long
I just found out there's something wrong
And nothing will get better if I stay


There's no need to explain anymore
I tried my best to love you, now I'm walking out the door
You used me, you deceived me
And you never seemed to need me
But I'll bet you won't forget me when I go

Seems I've been lost in a dream
Pretending that you care
But now I've opened up my eyes
And found it's all been just a great big fairytale


I've been loving' you so long
Don't think I'd even know how to forget you
But now the way that things have been
I think I'm better off alone
Than to be with you




Seems like I've been lost in a dream
Pretending you were mine
Someday you'll open up your eyes
And realize that a good man's hard to find
Fame and fortune
How empty they can be
But when I hold you in my arms
That's heaven to me

Who cares for fame and fortune
They're only passing things
But the touch of your lips on mine
Makes me feel like a king

Your kind of love
Is a treasure I hold
It's so much greater
Than silver or gold

I know that I have nothing
If you should go away
But to know that you love me
Brings fame and fortune my way

But to know that you love me
Brings fame and fortune my way

Tempted and tried we're oft' made to wonder
Why it should be thus all the day long
While there are others living about us
Never molested, though in the wrong


Farther along we'll know more about it
Farther along we'll understand why
Cheer up my brother live in the sunshine
We'll understand it all by and by


When death has come and taken our loved ones
Leaving our homes so lonely and drear
Then do we wonder how others prosper
Living so wicked year after year


Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night


Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Everybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night


Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing
Fever started long ago

Never know how much I love you
Never knew how much I care
When you put your arms around me
I get a fever that's so hard to bear


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Sun lights up the daytime
Moon lights up the night
I light up when you call my name
And you know I'm gonna treat you right


You give me fever when you kiss me
Fever when you hold me tight
Fever in the morning
Fever all through the night

Ev'rybody's got the fever
That is something you all know
Fever isn't such a new thing

Romeo loved Juliet
Juliet she felt the same
When he put his arms around her
He said 'Julie, baby, you're my flame
Thou giv-est fever when we kisseth
Fever with thy flaming youth
Fever I'm afire
Fever yea I burn forsooth

Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
I won't weep and I won't moan
Because I found you and your love so true
And I'm keeping you for my own

Heads I win or tails I lose
I bet my heart to win your love
The day you kissed me, good luck was with me
And I thank my lucky stars above


I'm not the kind to play for fun
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
The loser has to pay the score
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more


I'm not the kind to play for fun
I only play for keeps and I'm keeping all the love I won
Finders, keepers, losers, weepers
The loser has to pay the score
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
Yeah he lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
He lost you and I found you
And I'm keeping you for ever more
Baby, you know me well
You know I mean what I say
Before I say farewell
I'll give you just another day


You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone

Tell me what you're gonna do
You'd better make up your mind
It all depends on you
I'm leaving you behind


You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, no, no
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone, gone, yeah


Baby, you know it's true
We've been through thick and thin
But if you don't come through
You won't ever see me again


You'd better find out what's happening
Find out what's happening before long, oh Lord
If you don't find out what's happening
You're gonna find out that I'm gone


You'd better find

You better find out

You'd better find

You better find out


When they gave out eyes like diamonds
That would shame the stars that shine
My darling, my darling
You were the first in line

When they gave out lips like honey
That hold a new thrill every time
My darling, my darling
You were the first in line


There may be others that know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do

Don't refuse me, say you'll choose me
I'm yours, oh please be mine
My darling, say I'm your darling
The first and the last in line


There may be others that know you longer
Who pledge their hearts to you
But there's no other could love you stronger
Any stronger than I do

There were five sleepyheads
All tucked into their beds
While I sang a lullaby
One got dream dust in her eye


There were four sleepyheads
Playing possum with me
Mr. Sandman came by
And then there were three


Moonbeams play peek-a-boo
Three away became two
And my song was almost done
When the land of Nod took one


Kissed the last one good night
Then I heard not a peep
There were five sleepyheads
Now they're all fast asleep
Every man has a flaming star
A flaming star over his shoulder
And when a man sees his flaming star
He knows his time, his time has come


Flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
Flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
There's a lot of living I've gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Flaming star 


When I ride, I feel that flaming star
That flaming star over my shoulder
And so I ride front of that flaming star
Never looking around, never looking around


Flaming star, don't shine on me, flaming star
Flaming star, keep behind me, flaming star
There's a lot of living I've gotta do
Give me time to make a few dreams come true
Flaming star 

I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sitting on a hollow stump
I'm like a Mississippi bullfrog sitting on a hollow stump
I've got so many women I don't know which way to jump


I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I said flip flop and fly I don't care if I die
I won't ever leave Don't ever say goodbye


I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need

When your heart gets restless, time to move along
When your heart gets weary, time to sing a song
But when a dream is calling you
There's just one thing that you can do


Well, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
You gotta follow that dream to find the love you need

Keep a-moving, move along, keep a moving


Gotta find me someone whose heart is free
Someone to look for my dream with me
And when I find her, I may find out
Just what my dreams are all about


I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
I've gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead
I gotta follow that dream to find the love I need
I hear the train a comin', it's rolling 'round the bend
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on
When I hear that whistle blowing, down in San Antone

When I was just a baby my mama told me, "Son
Always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns"
But I shot a man in London just to watch him die
When I hear that whistle blowing, I hang my head and cry

Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Train I ride, sixteen coaches long
Well that long black train got my baby and gone

Train train, coming around, around the bend
Train train, coming around, around the bend
Well it took my baby, but it never will again

Are you motherfuckers ready 

Hot Chevy on a friday night
And the sweat drips down my spine
I put an axe in my baby's head
I'm gonna end up doing time
You look so good in red
American nightmare running scared

Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone


Fool, you could have made her want you
Fool, you could have made her love you
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone


Gone now, the love and laughter
See yourself the morning after
Can't you see her eyes are misty
As she said goodbye


Fool, you didn't have to hurt her
Fool, you didn't have to lose her
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone


Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Fool, you only had to love her
But now her love is gone

Fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well, fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well, I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me, too


Well, well, when I first met you, baby
Well, I knew I couldn't win
But I just kept right on trying
'Cause trying is no sin


What a fool, fool, fool
That I was to fall for you
Well, I know what a fool I was
To think that you could love me, too


Well, when I first met you, baby
Well, I knew I couldn't win
But I just kept right on trying
'Cause trying is no sin

Fools fall in in love in a hurry
Fools give their hearts much too soon
Just put in two bars of "Stardust"
Just hang out one silly moon


Oh, they've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool

Fools fall in love just like schoolgirls
Blinded by rose colored dreams
They build their castles on wishes
With only rainbows for beams


Oh, they're making plans for the future
When they should be right back in school
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool, all right


They've got their love torches burning
When they should be playing it cool
I used to laugh but now I'm the same
Take a look at a brand new fool
Take a look at a brand new fool
Fools rush in
Where angels fear to tread
And so I come to you my love
My heart above my head

Though I see the danger there
If there's a chance for me
Then I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Fools rush in
Where wise men never go
But wise men never fall in love
So how are they to know


When we met
I felt my life begin
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in

And I don't care
Oh, oh, oh, oh





 
So open up your heart and let
This fool rush in
If I should go, forget me never
Please say that you'll remember me
I pray the dreams we share together
Will shine on in your memory


Each time a star falls out of heaven
It leaves the sky a deeper blue
So if we part, forget me never
And don't forget my love for you
And don't forget my love for you
Before you go, walk out on me
Take a look around, tell me what you see
Here I stand like an open book
Is there something here, you might have overlooked

'Cause it would be a shame if you should leave
And find that freedom ain't what you thought it would be


The years we had were not all bad
In fact I know the good outweighed the bad
Now you say that you've grown tired
You want to be by yourself awhile
It would be a shame if you should go
And find that freedom was a long time ago


I know that you can't stand the chains that bind you
They just keep on drivin' us apart
And you could go where I could never find you
But could you go far enough to get away from your heart


So one more time, for ol' times sake
Come and lay your head upon my chest
Please don't throw this moment away
We can forget the bad and take the best

If you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake


And if you don't have nothing left to say
Let me hold you one more time for ol' times sake
Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning


Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times


I'll get along , you'll find another
And I'll be here  if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me


Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time
For the good times

Don't look so sad, I know it's over
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning


Lay your head upon my pillow
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine
Hear the whisper of the raindrops falling soft against the window
And make believe you love me one more time

For the Good times
I'll get along, you'll find another
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me




For the good times
For the good times
Had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you
Had a dream and woke up crying
Well I can roll but I just can't rock
And the time's going by, tick-tock
For the heart, I just can't love no-one but you


Well I'm high and dry and lonely, I'm as lonely as can be
And I stare out of my window
Well I can play but I just can't win
And the weather's looking dim
For the heart I just can't love no-one but you


For the heart
For the heart
For the heart I just can't love no-one but you

For the heart
For the heart
For the heart I just can't love no-one but you


Had a dream about you baby, had a dream about me and you
Had a dream and woke up crying
Well I can roll but I just can't rock
And the time's going by, tick-tock
For the heart, I just can't love no-one but you

For the millionth and the last time
Darling, let me hold you tight
One more kiss, and then I promise
I will say my last goodnight

Though your lips are so inviting
And I know I'll want to stay
Give me one more kiss to dream on
And I'll be on my way


It seems a million or so kisses ago
We said goodnight at your door
I didn't get far 'cause here we are
And I'm still begging for more


While the millionth and the last star
Slowly disappears from sight
For the millionth and the last time
Let me kiss you good-night




While the millionth and the last star
Slowly disappears from sight
For the millionth and the last time
Let me kiss you good night
Let me kiss you good night
Let me kiss you good night

Now ain't this outfit something special 
Well, we heard rumors from the bases
Frankfort girls got pretty faces


Go, Special, go
Blow, whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa 

Now when we get to our headquarters
We'll be good boys and follow orders

Round wheels singing on a long flat track
Boiler busting to blow its stack
Towns and villages flying by
Farewell, fraulein, don't you cry
You'll soon get another G.I

Come on, train, and get the lead out
Well, one more day we gotta sweat out
Frantic frauleins at the station
They're ready for a celebration


Go, Special, go
Blow, whistle, blow
Frankfort Special's got a special way to go
Whoa 

Frankie and me, we were lovers
Oh lordy how we did love
Swore we'd be true to each other
Just as true as stars above
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong


My luck in poker was fading
When a new gal caught my eye
I gambled, I tried to change my luck
With a chick named Nellie Bly
I was Frankie's man but I was doing her wrong


Yeah! Frankie came looking to find me
Yes, she wasn't looking for fun
For in her sweet loving hand
She was toting' a .44 gun
To shoot her man if he was doing' her wrong


Well Frankie looked into the bar room
And right there in front of her eyes
There was her loving Johnny
Making love to that Nellie Bly
I was her man, she caught me doing her wrong

From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding ring
I've played an ace and I won the queen
I walked away with your heart

From a jack to a king
With no regrets I stacked, I stacked the cards, I stacked the cards last night
And lady luck played her hand just right
You made me king of your heart

 
Oh for just a little while I thought that I might lose the game
Oh but just in time I saw that twinkle in your eyes
From a jack to a king of loneliness to a wedding, wedding, wedding ring
I played an ace and I won the queen
You made me king of your heart
Acapulco, sleeping in the bay
Acapulco, wake up and greet the day
Time to tell the guitars and sleepy eyed stars


To be on their way
It's such a beautiful morning
For a holiday


Hey now come on, you old sleepy head
See the sky turning red and you're still in bed
It's fun in Acapulco

Acapulco, look here comes the sun
Acapulco, it's a day for fun




This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
This is no time for siesta, this is time for fun
Well, hello there
My, it's been a long, long time
How am I doing 
Oh, well, I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now, and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away 


How's your new love 
I hope that he's doing fine
Heard you told him, "yes," baby
That you'd love him 'til the end of time
Well, you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well, it seems like just the other day
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away 
Yeah, baby

Yeah


I got to go now
Guess I'll see you hanging 'round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time you gonna pay


Well ain't it surprising how time slips away 
Yeah, ain't it surprising how time slips away 
Well hello there
My it's been a long long time
How am I doing
Oh well I guess I'm doing fine
It's been so long now and it seems that
It was only yesterday
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away


How's your new love
I hope that he's doing fine
Heard you told him, yes baby
That you'd love him till the end of time
Well you know, that's the same thing
That you told me
Well it seems like just the other day
Mm, ain't it funny how time slips away

Got to go now
Guess I'll see you hanging round
Don't know when though, oh
Never know when I'll be back in town
But I remember what I told you
That in time you re going to pay





Well ain't it surprising how time slips away
Yeah, ain't it surprising how time slips awayIt's knowin' that your door is always open
And your path is free to walk, mmm
That makes me tend to keep my sleeping bag
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch

It's knowin' I'm not shackled
By forgotten words and bonds
And the ink stains that have dried upon some line

That keeps you in the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
That keeps you ever gentle on my mind
It's not clinging to the rocks and ivy
Planted on their columns now that bind me
Or something that somebody said
Because they thought we fit together walking


It's just knowing that the world will not be cursing
Or forgiving
When I walk along some railroad track and find
That you're moving on the backroads
By the rivers of my memory
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind

Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines
And the junkyards and the highways come between us

And some other woman's cryin' to her mother
Cause she turned and I was gone

I still might run in silence, tears of joy might stain my face
And the summer sun might burn me 'til I'm blind
But not to where I cannot see you walkin' in the backroads
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind

I dip my cup of soup back from a gurglin'
Crackin' caldron in some train yard

My beard a rustlin'
Cold towel, and a dirty hat
Pulled low across my face

Gently your eyes met mine
Tender, trusting, true
Gently your hand took mine
Thrilled me through and through


Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Gently, oh so gently
Our true love was born

Gently your lips kissed mine
As we strolled along
Gently your heart touched mine
Young and warm and strong


Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Gently, oh so gently
Our true love was born


Gently the hour is near
When true loves have to part
Gently we'll meet again
One more kiss, sweetheart


Gently, oh so gently
Gentle as the dawn
Gently, oh so gently
Our true love was born
Our true love was bornAn old cowboy went ridin' out
On a dark and windy day
Upon a ridge he rested as
He went along his way
When all at once a mighty herd
Of red-eyed cows he saw
Plowing through the ragged skies
And up the cloudy draw

Their brands were still on fire and
Their hooves were made of steel
Their horns were black and shining and
Their hot breath he could feel
A bolt of fear went through him as
They thundered through the sky
For he saw the riders coming hard
And he heard their mournful cry:

Yippee-yi-yo, yippee-yi-ya

Their faces gaunt their eyes were blurred
Their shirts all soaked with sweat
They're riding hard to catch that herd
But they ain't caught 'em yet
'cause they've got to ride forever on
That range up in the sky
On horses snortin' fire
As they ride on hear their cry:

They give us a room with a view of the beautiful Rhine
They give us a room with a view of the beautiful Rhine
But give me a muddy old creek in Texas any old time
I've got those hup, two, three, four, Occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon, I'm gonna blow my fuse


We get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow
We get hasenpfeffer and black pumpernickel for chow
I'd blow my next month's pay for a slice of Texas cow
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march
We'd like to be heroes, but all that we do here is march
And they don't give the Purple Heart for a fallen arch
I've got those hup, two, three, four, Occupation G.I. Blues
From my G.I. hair to the heels of my G.I. shoes
And if I don't go stateside soon, I'm gonna blow my fuse


The frauleins are pretty as flowers, but we can't make a pass
The frauleins are pretty as flowers, but we can't make a pass
'Cause they're all wearing signs saying: "Keepen sie off the grass"

Girl happy, yes, I'm girl happy
Girl happy, can't you see 


Every girl I see looks good to me
What a crazy way-out way to be
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women
Well I'm girl happy, yes, I'm girl happy
Girl happy, can't you see 

Every time I see a pretty face
My heart just heads for outer space
I need a girl to make my life worth living
Yes, I'm girl happy, yes, I'm girl happy
Girl happy, can't you see 


I've been like this since I was just a baby boy
First nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
Mama, keep your daughter out of sight
I'm in a loving mood tonight
I love a life of nothing but beautiful women
Well, I'm girl happy, yes, I'm girl happy
Girl happy, can't you see 


I've been like this since I was just a baby boy
First nurse that ever rocked my cradle made me jump for joy
Girl happy, well, I'm girl happy
Yes, I'm girl happy, can't you see 
Girl happy, said I'm girl happy
Yes, I'm girl happy, can't you see 
The girl next door went a-walking
She found the boy she likes
She wanted to get married
Settle down for life


The girl next door went a-walking
She knew it wasn't right
She came home half past ten
Late every night


The girl next door went a-walking
She found the boy she likes
She wanted to get married
Settle down for life


She didn't know love was so grand
She never took love second hand
But to my surprise
She thought that love was paradise


The girl next door went a-walking
She found the boy she likes
She wanted to get married
Settle down for life

When you're asleep beside me, I watch you lying there
Your hand upon the pillow and moonlight in your hair
I get the warmest feeling, so good I almost cry
I kiss your sleeping lips and say I'll love you 'till I die


Oh, girl of mine, you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So, girl of mine, turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you, girl of mine

Sometimes I know I hurt you when things ain't goin' right
I walk away and leave you to face the lonely night
I wouldn't blame you, darling, if you walked out on me
But I return to find you there still waiting patiently


Oh, girl of mine, you make my day
One sunny smile and all the clouds just roll away
Eyes deep as the sea seem to say to me
Our love will always be
So, girl of mine, turn out the light
And in my arms together we'll make sweet love tonight
Down life's golden road and you'll always know
I love you, girl of mine
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!


 Going swimming  in bikinis
A walking and wiggling by, yay yay yay
 On the beaches, girls, oh, what peaches
So pretty, Lord I could cry


I'm just a red-blooded boy
And I can't stop thinking about


 Sailing sailboats,  water skiing
They'll drive me out of my mind, yay, yay, yay
 Big and brassy,  small and sassy
Just give me one of each kind yay, yay


I'm just a red-blooded boy
And I can't stop thinking about
Girls! Girls! Girls! Girls!


And when I pick up a sandwich to munch
A crunchy crunchety, a crunchety crunch
I never ever get to finish my lunch
Because there's always bound to be a bunch of

Give me the right
To hold you tonight
The tears that I've cried over you
Give me the right


You can't say no
When I need you so
I want you back in my arms
Give me the right

If you looked deep in your heart
Like I looked into mine
You'll find that nothing has changed
Our love was there all the time


Why make me plead
For something you need 
I want to bring back the thrill
Give me the right


Why make me plead
For something you need 
I want to bring back the thrill
Give me the rightI'm going to where the desert sun is
Go where I know the fun is
Go where the harem girls dance
Go where there's love and romance

Out on the burning sands, in some caravan
I'll find adventure, while I can
To say the least, go on, go east young man


Go east young man, go east young man
You'll feel like a sheik, so rich and grand
With dancing girls at your command
Go eat and drink and feast, go east young man


I'm going to go where the night's enchanted
Go where those dreams are granted
When paradise starts calling, into some tent I'm crawling

I hear those desert drums, and when nighttime comes
Then I'll make love the way I planned
To say the least, go on, go east young man



This proud wild land where the wind blows free
Has always been a part of me
It's in my blood, I just can't get it out
For a hundred miles a man can see
And be about as wild as he wants to be
If he feels like shouting all he's got to do is shout


Where the purple mountains reach up high
And look like they're going to touch the sky
Where the canyon walls have stood for a million years
Where the days are hot, the nights are cold
The desert sand looks just like gold
These trails were carved in sweat and blood and tears

Where the painted desert as you pass by
Looks like a rainbow in the sky
The cactus blooms in the early morning sun
Where the nightwings sing and eagles fly
The clouds paint pictures in the sky
The coyotes howl tells you when the day is done


I'm coming home, this time I'm going to stay
I'm coming home and I am never going away
My feet are itching to get back home
I've had the desert fever since I've been gone
I need some loving so bad that I can't see
When a woman looks a man in the eye
You know it takes a man to satisfy
Thinking about them girls is killing me


I'm going home, going home
Going home, I'm going home
Going home, going home
Going home
Say you're mine, then ask me what you will
All your dreams, my darling I'll fulfill


Golden coins, I will bring to you
Silver trinkets and rubies too
In return dear I'm begging you
For the pleasures of love


I'll bring gifts, like you never saw
Priceless garments that you'll adore
Persian rugs to enhance your floor
For the pleasures of love


Darling, choose anything you please
Rich brocade, or woven tapestries
In exchange, I plead on my knees
For the pleasure of love


Golden coins, I'll place at your feet
Precious jewels to make life complete
All my treasures are yours my sweet

Hear that old train whistle
Howling in the night
If that flyer's southbound
Things will be all right

I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow


Don't nobody tell me
Baby's been untrue
If she's been unfaithful
I don't know what I'll do

I'm leaving now, leaving now, leaving now
I'm gonna get back home somehow


Never thought that I could miss her so
I never thought I could, but now I know


That the sound of the old train whistle
Makes me want to cry
Reminds me of that lonely feeling
When I said goodbye

Don't want a four leaf clover
Don't want an old horse shoe
Want your kiss, 'cause I just can't miss
With a good luck charm like you


Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm, a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

Don't want a silver dollar
Rabbit's foot on a string
The happiness in your warm caress
No rabbit's foot can bring


Come on and be my little good luck charm
Uh-huh huh, you sweet delight
I want a good luck charm, a-hanging on my arm
To have, to have, to hold, to hold tonight

Uh-huh huh 
Uh-huh huh 
Uh-huh huh 
Oh yeah

Uh-huh huh 
Uh-huh huh 
Uh-huh huh 
Tonight


If I found a lucky penny
I'd toss it across the bay
Your love is worth all the gold on earth
No wonder that I say

Well, I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight
Well, I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight


I'm gonna hold my baby as tight as I can
Tonight she'll know I'm a mighty, mighty man
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight


I say, "Well, meet me in a hurry, behind the barn
Don't you be afraid, thatI 'll do you no harm
I want you to bring along my rocking shoes
'Cause tonight I'm gonna rock away all my blues"
I heard the news
There's good rockin' tonight


Well, we're gonna rock
We gonna rock
Let's rock
Come on and rock
We're gonna rock
All our blues away

Everybody's gone away
Said they're movin to L.A
There's not a soul I know around
Everybody's leavin' town


Some caught a freight, some caught a plane
Found the sunshine, leave the rain
They said this town will waste their time
I guess they're right, it's wasting mine


Some gotta win, some gotta lose
Good time Charlie's got the blues
Good time Charlie's got the blues


You know my heart keeps tellin' me
You're not a kid at thirty-three
Play around, you'll lose your wife
You play it too long you'll lose your life


Oh yes, I've got a lot of living to do
A whole lot of loving to do
Come on, baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes I've got a lot of living to do
Whole lot of loving to do
Well, there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you


There's a moon that's big and bright
In the milky way tonight
But the way you act, you never would know it's there
Now baby, time's a-wasting
A lot of kisses I am not been tasting
I don't know about you, but I'm going to get my share

I got a lot of living to do
Whole lot of loving to do
Come on, baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes, I've got a lot of living to do
Whole lot of loving to do
Well, there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you


There's a balmy little breeze
That's a-whistling through the trees
And it's telling you to pitch a little woo with me
Why don't you take a listen
You'll never know what you've been missing
Cuddle up real close and be my little honey bee


Got a lot of living to do
Got a lotta loving to do
Come on, baby, to make a party takes two
Oh yes, I've got a lot of living to do
Whole lotta loving to do
Well, there's no one who I'd rather do it with-a than you


You're the prettiest thing I've seen
But you treat me so doggone mean
Ain't you got no heart, I'm dying to hold you near
Why do you keep me waiting 
Why don't you start cooperating 
And the things I say, the things you want to hear

Hands off of her, she belongs to me
Mojo working don't belong to you
Well, she's mine all mine no matter what you do
Play it boys, play it boys

The old hometown looks the same
As I step down from the train
And there to meet me is my Mama and Papa
Down the road, I look and there runs Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home


Yes, they'll all come to meet me
All creatures smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home


The old house is still standing
Though the paint is cracked and dry
And there's that old oak tree that I used to play on
Down the lane, I'll walk with my sweet Mary
Hair of gold and lips like cherries
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home


Yes, they'll all come to meet me
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home

Guadalajara, Guadalajara

Hueles a limpio, a rosa temprana

Sabes a pura tierra mojada

Ay, ay, ay, ay, ay, ay

Ay! Colomitos lejanos
Ay! Ojitos de agua hermanos

Nos nos dejaba ir hasta Zapopan

Ay mis hermanos ay-ay-ay Mexicano

Well, I quit my job down at the car wash
I left my mama a goodbye note
By sundown I'd left Kingston
With my guitar under my coat
I hitchhiked all the way down to Memphis
Got a room at the YMCA
For the next three weeks I went hunting them nightclubs
Just looking for a place to play
Well, I thought my picking would set them on fire
But nobody wanted to hire a guitar man


Well, I nearly about starved to death down in Memphis
I run out to money and luck
So I bought me a ride down to Macon, Georgia
On a overloaded poultry truck
I thumbed on down to Panama City
Started picking out some of them all night bars
Hoping I could make myself a dollar
Making music on my guitar
I got the same old story at them all night piers
"There ain't no room around here for a guitar man"
"We don't need a guitar man, son"


So I slept in the hobo jungles
Roamed a thousand miles of track
Till I found myself in Mobile, Alabama
At a club they call Big Jack's
A little four-piece band was jamming
So I took my guitar and I sat in
I showed them what a band would sound like
With a swinging little guitar man
Show them, son
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
Keep your hands off of her
She don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
She's long, lean and lanky
Tadadadaadaaa
Hands off of her, she don't belong to you
She's mine, o mine, no matter what I do
Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me


Hard luck stories get me so upset
Like Romeo and Juliet
I'm not smart enough to figure why
Some folks enjoy a real good cry

Happy ending, happy ending
Give me a story with a happy ending
When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me



Never thought that I would stand a chance
That you'd give me a second glance
But I think that you can play the part
And give a guy a happy heart




When boy meets girl and then they never part again
But live forever happily like you and me

Like you and me, like you and me

I saw the harbor lights


They only told me we were parting
Those same old harbor lights
That once brought you to me


I watched the harbor lights
How could I help it 
Tears were starting
Good-bye to golden nights
Beside the silvery seas


I long to hold you dear
And kiss you just once more
But you were on the ship
And I was on the shore


Now I know lonely nights
For all the while my heart keeps praying
That someday harbor lights
Will bring you back to meWell a hard headed woman
A soft hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
Well a hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of a man

Now Adam told to Eve
"Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messin' round that apple tree"
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
Well a hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of a man
Now Samson told Delilah
Loud and clear
"Keep your cotton pickin' fingers
Out my curly hair"
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
Well a hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of a man

I heard about a king
Who was doin' swell
Till he started playing
With that evil Jezebel
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
Well a hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of a man

I got a woman
A head like a rock
If she ever went away
I'd cry around the clock
Oh yeah, ever since the world began
Well a hard headed woman been
A thorn in the side of a man
Man man man man man man man
Well, a hard-headed woman
A soft-hearted man
Been the cause of trouble
Ever since the world began


Oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man


Now Adam told to Eve
"Listen here to me
Don't you let me catch you
Messing round that apple tree"


Oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man

Oh yeah 
Ever since the world began
A hard-headed woman
Been a thorn in the side of man

Some kids born with a silver spoon
I guess that I was born a little too soon
Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
Cause I've had my share


Some kids born as rich as a king
But I was born without a doggone thing


Hard knocks, all I ever knew was hard knocks
And I'm telling you, I said you'd better beware
Cause I've had my share


I walked a million miles I bet
Tired and hungry and cold and wet
I've heard that lonesome whistle blow
From New York City down to Mexico
Some kids born fancy-free
Nobody never gave nothing to me but

Oh, I'm really feeling mighty low
No, no, no, I got no place that I can go
So I've got some blues to sing
And oh, so much remembering, woe


Black cats, keep away from me
Take my advice, go shinning up a tree
I got hard luck, the hardest kind a luck you'll find
I ain't lyin', I've got the bluest kinda blues
Driving' me right outta my mind

She's gone, said toodle-loo
Kissed her goodbye and my, my, my money too
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck you've seen
I mean, the way I'm running' lately
My lucky number is thirteen


Where do I belong, everything I do is wrong
All wrong, wrong as can be
Who's stacking all the decks
Lady luck has got the hex on me
I'm on her knee da da da da


Shove off, oh, I'm warning you
This thing I caught, you know could be catching too
I've got hard luck, the hardest kinda luck there can be
Yes, sir, I guess hard luck always chooses
Natural born losers like me, oh ah
Going to travel, going to travel wild and free
I'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
Every pretty girl's going to know I'm around
They're going to know I'm in town on a harem holiday

Twenty women, twenty women by my side
I'm going to kiss them all, because I've got to keep them satisfied
Going to have the best time money can buy
I'm going to be flying high on a harem holiday


If Romeo had a harem holiday
You can bet that Juliet would have never been his girl forever


Going to go back, going to catch that midnight plane
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
Catch that midnight plane
Twenty dancing girls are waiting just to call my name
Going to have a ball, I am not going to waste no time
I'm going to make them all mine on a harem holiday




Going to travel, going to travel wild and free
I'm going to pack my bags because this great big world is calling me
Every pretty girl's going to know I'm around
They're going to know I'm in town on a harem holiday
Now once it was told to me, we're born with a magic key
It opens the door to miracles of spring
It takes you to wishing wells, to ice cream and carousels
And yet this magic key won't unlock a thing


Unless you have a happy, you have a happy
Have a happy, warm smiling face
I start believing, in believing
Let your address be sunshine place


There's love and there's joy I'm told
Much more than your heart can hold
It's there like the ring you'd grab on a merry-go-round
The world isn't half as gray with friends on a rainy day
But people keep away when you wear a frown, you've got


To have a happy, you have a happy
Have a happy warm smiling face
Start believing, in believing
Let your address be sunshine place
Let your address be sunshine place
Let your address be sunshine place
Have I told you lately that I love you 
Could I tell you once again somehow 
Have I told with all my heart and soul how I adore you 
Well darling, I'm telling you now

Have I told you lately when I'm sleeping
Every dream I dream is you somehow 
Have I told you why the nights are long
When you're not with me 
Well darling, I'm telling you now

My heart would break in two if I should lose you
I'm no good without you anyhow
And have I told you lately that I love you

Hawaiian sunset peeping from the sea
Smiles and says aloha to his sweetheart Hawaii
The drowsy islands slumber one by one
Close their sleepy eyelids say goodnight to the sun


Then Hawaii like millions of times before
Blossoms in her lover's arms once more
Too soon the sunrise will wake her from her sleep
So until tomorrow, sleep Hawaii sleep


Then Hawaii like millions of times before

Soon bells will be ringing 
This is the moment
Of sweet Aloha

Refrain 
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writin' you this letter, and this is what I have to say

Chorus
All I really wanted was someone to care
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What you do to me, look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with me emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me, you take what you did to me

II 
Now I see that you've been doin' wrong
And played me all along
And made a fool of me, baby
You got it all wrong to think that I wouldn't find out

That you were cheatin' on me baby
How could you do it to me



Chorus
All I really wanted was someone to care
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind

I 
You said you'd be here by 9
And said you took your time
You didn't think to call me, boy
Here I sit, tryin' not to cry
Askin' myself why
You'd do this to me

Refrain 
Since you're not around for me to tell you baby face to face
I'm writin' you this letter, and this is what I have to say

Chorus
All I really wanted was someone to care
Instead you told me lies when someone else was on your mind
What you do to me, look what you did to me
I thought that you were someone who would do me right
Until you played with me emotions and you made me cry
What you do to me, you take what you did to me

Now the bell hops tears keep flowing
The desk clerks dressed in black
Well they've been so long on lonely street
They'll never look back

In a little while you're leaving
Starting on the journey home
Soon I'll be alone, the one who loves you
La la la la la, somewhere in the heart of Rome


I'll make a wish in every fountain
Say a prayer that you'll return
Minutes I'll be counting
May the fire of love still burn
I'll keep your picture by my pillow
And pretend I'm not alone
Make believe that you are with me
La la la la la, in the heart of Rome


Suddenly the tears are falling
As we hear the whistle blow
Hold me very close before you leave me
La la la la la, somewhere in the heart of Rome

 Hearts made of stone will never break
'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay

These hearts of stone will cause you pain
Although you love there has stopped just the same
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay
But they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone

Hearts made of stone will never break
'Cause your love is never there, they just don't care
You can ask and plea, please, please, please work
And all your love is there to stay
Cause they'll say no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
You daddy know, I thought I knew hearts made of stone
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way
But a whisper of His voice softly calling
To the arms of my Maker to stay


He is my reason for living
Oh He is the king of all kings
I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything


After the lighting and thunder
After the last bell has rung
I want to bow down before Him
And hear Him say well done


I long to be His possession
Oh, He is my everything
I remember my days of darkness
Without sunshine or sight to lead the way

My Jesus knows when I am lonely
He knows each pain, he sees each tear
He understands each lonely heartache
He understands because he cares


My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes, He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies
Yes, he knows just what I need

My Jesus knows just what I need
Oh yes, He knows just what I need
He satisfies and every need supplies

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go


You can't say the words I want to hear
When you're with another man
If you love me, answer yes or no
Darling, I will understand


Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone
Tell the man to turn the juke box way down low
You can tell your friend there with you, he'll have to go




Just put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone
Just pretend that we're together all alone

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane

Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus lane

He's got a bag that's filled with toys
For boys and girls again
Hear those sleigh bells jingle jangle
What a beautiful sight
Jump in bed and cover up your head
Because Santa Claus comes tonight

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus lane

He doesn't care if you're a rich or poor boy
He loves you just the same
Santa knows that we're God's children
That makes everything right
Fill your hears with Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight

Well, here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Riding down Santa Claus lane

He'll come around when the chimes ring out
It's Christmas morn again
Peace on earth will come to all
If we just follow the light
Let's give thanks to the Lord above
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen, Blitzen, all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins

Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings and say a prayer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight


Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus

Here comes Santa Claus, here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
He doesn't care if you're rich or poor
He loves you just the same
I thank the Lord for everything
When things are going my way
He said to me, 'I will comfort thee'
'And drive your cares away'
He promised me, 'I will walk with thee'
'And drive your cares away'

I did not ask for riches
He gave me wealth untold
The moon, the stars, the sun, the sky
Are there for you to behold

I thank the Lord for everything
And I count my blessings each day
He came to me when I needed Him
I only have to pray
And He'll come to you - if you ask Him to
He's only a prayer away
He's your uncle, not your dad
He's the best friend you ever had
So, come on, dig, dig, dig in until it hurts
Just remember Pearl Harbor
The Alamo and nothing could be worse


He's your favorite relative
And he needs a lot to live
So just bring, bring, bring everything until you bleed
And he'll send back what he don't need


If you're naughty, Form 1040's your salvation
By deprivation of temptation
Dark and blondes I hear are not deductible
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me 


When he calls you as he may do
Don't be frightened, red white and blue
Just be thankful you don't live in Leningrad
He's your uncle, not your dad


If you're honest, you don't have to shake and shiver
The food is lousy up the river
It's give and take and he does all the taking
Oh, say, can you see if there's anything left for me 

Shackled by a heavy burden
Need the Lord again and shame
Then the hand of Jesus touched me
And now I am no longer the same


For he touched me
He touched me
He touched me
And what a wonderful joy
Joy that foods my soul
Something happened and now I know
He touched me
And made me whole


Oh since I met this blessed Savior
And since he cleansed and made me whole
Oh I never cease
Never cease to praise Him
I'll shout it while eternity rolls

Line up girls, I'll show you what to do
This boat will sparkle like a diamond when we get through
By the numbers there is not much time
We're gonna start an assembly line


Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey! Hey! Hey!

You get the hammer baby, you get the nails
You get the paint, you get the brush
Because we're gonna give it the special touch




We got a magic potion that will help us win
I don't know how to spell it but dip right in
Glocoseoxytonicphosphate, it's the latest scoop
But that's all right girls you can call it "Goop"

Hey Jude, don't be a fool
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better


Hey Jude, don't let me down
Take a sad song and make it better
The minute you let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better

Let it out and let in

Who plays it cool
In making the world a little better

You may ask me how I know
My Lord is real 
You may doubt the things I say
And doubt the way I feel 
But I know He's real today
He'll always be 
I can feel His hand in mine
And that's enough for me


I will never walk alone
He holds my hand 
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall, I know He'll understand
Till the day He tells me why
He loves me so
I can feel His hand in mine
That's all I need to know


I will never walk alone
He holds my hand 
He will guide each step I take
And if I fall, I know He'll understand

Somewhere in, in the distant night
I hear Christmas bells
The gentle snow keeps falling down on people
Who are homeward bound
That's the way it's always been
The circle really never ends
Christmas seems to come and go
Home's a place that I don't know
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
It's that time of year

Lights aglow and mistletoe
Don't mean a thing when you're not here
As I walk, walk this lonely street
The sound of snow beneath my feet
I'll think of how, how it used to be
Holly leaves and Christmas trees
Used to mean so much to me

Home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home
I don't need a mansion on a hill
That overlooks the sea
Anywhere you're with me is home


Maybe I'm a rolling stone
Who won't amount to much
But everything that I hold dear
Is close enough to touch

For home is where the heart is
And my heart is anywhere you are
Anywhere you are is home




Hot dog, you say you're really coming back
Hot dog, I'm waitin' at the railway track
Hot dog, you say you're coming home for good
Hot dog, I'm gonna keep knocking on wood
And baby, I can hardly wait
I'm going to meet you at the gate, hot dog


I fell in love with you and then you went away
But now you're coming home to stay
Hot dog, soon everything will be all right
Hot dog, we're gonna have a ball tonight
I got a pocketful of dimes
It's going to be just like old times, hot dog

You went away and every day was misery
But now you're coming back to me
Hot dog, my heart is gonna go insane
Hot dog, when you come walking off the train
Oh, how lonely I have been
But when that Santa Fe pulls in
Hot dog, baby, hot dog 
You ain't nothin' but a hound dog
Cryin' all the time

Oh you can take a whole lot of sand
And build a castle on the beach
And though you mold it and you plan
Still you got nothing in your reach


One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art


You can build a tower of clay
But if you ask my advice
Well it is worthless as I say
I got no heart it's cold as ice

 
One little slip and it tumbles down
One wrong step and it crumbles all around
Like a house without love, that's sure to fall apart
A house of sand is an empty work of art

How can you lose what you never had
I tell myself when I'm feeling sad

 
You don't have the right to cry
You believed your own lie
It's your fault because
You thought that she was yours
Think it over once, think it over twice
I wish I could take my own advice
I know I should be glad, why does it hurt so bad
How can you lose what you never had
How can you lose what you never had
How do you think I feel 
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about
Is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel 


How do you think we stand 
Well, I know you've made your plans
But you've included three
And that's too much for me
How do you think I feel 

I won't be true again
I know that I can't win
So why should I pretend
That you still love me 


How do you think I feel 
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about
Is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel 


How do you think I feel 
Well, I know your love's not real
The girl I'm mad about
Is just a gadabout
How do you think I feel 


Well, how do you think we stand 
I know you've made your plans
Another's pretty face
Has put me out of place
How do you think I feel 

Oh Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the worlds thy hands have made
I see the stars, I hear the rolling thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed


When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
To take me home, what joy shall fill my heart
Then I shall bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim my God how great thou art

Then sings my soul my savior God to thee
How great thou art 
How great thou art 
Then sings my soul my savior God to thee

I've had nothing but sorrow
Since you said we were through
There's no hope for tomorrow
How's the world treating you 


Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
All my dreams have been shattered
How's the world treating you 


Got no plans for next Sunday
Got no plans for today
Every day is blue Monday
Every day you're away


Every sweet thing that mattered
Has been broken in two
And I'm asking you, darling
How's the world treating you How the web was woven
In my soul, don't you know
How the web was woven
Can't get loose, can't let go

Like the weave of a spider
Wound around my heart, I'm no longer free
At last I'm where you want me
Don't you know that's where, where I want to be 

Spinning 'round like a blue fly
Thoughts of you fill my head
And no matter, oh how I try
I can't sleep in my bed

I've been round for the last time
Oh girl, what can I do 
Oh, that's how the web was woven
How I fell in love, fell in love with you

I've been round for the last time
Oh girl, what can I do 
Oh, that's how the web was woven
How I fell in love, fell in love with you
Oh that's how the web was woven
How I fell in love, fell in love with you
How would you like to be 
A little circus clown
And you could wear a smile
Instead of a frown

How would you like to be 
A little kangaroo
A-hoppin' up and down
And I could hop with you


Come on and smile a little, smile a little
Hop a little, hop a little
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me

Come on and smile a little, smile a little
Hop a little, hop a little
Smile a little, hop a little bit with me


How would you like to be 
A little buzzing bee
And instead of a tree
You could buzz around me

I'm so hurt
To think that you lied to me
I'm hurt
Way down deep inside of me


You said our love was true
And we'd never, never part
Now you want someone new
And it breaks my heart 


I'm hurt
Much more than you'll ever know
Yes, darling, I'm so hurt
Because I still love you so


But even though you hurt me
Like nobody else could ever do
I would never ever hurt you
Not you, not you
I don't want my heart to be broken
'Cause it's the only one I've got
So darling, please be careful
You know I care a lot
Darling, please don't break my heart
I beg of you


I don't want no tears a-falling
You know I hate to cry
But that's what's bound to happen
If you would say goodbye
Darling, please don't say goodbye
I beg of you


Hold my hand and promise
That you'll always love me true
Make me know you'll love me
The same way I love you, little girl


You got me at your mercy
Now that I'm in love with you
So please don't take advantage
Because you know my love is true
Darling, please please love me too
I beg of you

I believe for every drop of rain that falls
A flower grows
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night
A candle glows

I believe for everyone who goes astray
Someone will come to show the way
I believe, I believe

I believe above a storm the smallest prayer
Can still be heard
I believe that someone in the great somewhere
Hears every word


Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe 

Every time I hear a new born baby cry
Or touch a leaf or see the sky
Then I know why
I believe 
The steps that lead to any church
Form a stairway to a star
They're part of God and should be trod
More often than they are


I believe in the man in the sky 
I believe with His help I'll get by 
My footsteps may falter
My eyes may grow dim
But He's my Gibraltar
I'm trusting in Him


Though a sparrow is all I may be 
On me, He will still keep an eye
Yes I'm singing His praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky


 Sparrow  Sparrow am I
 Keep an eye
Yes I'm singing His praise
Till the end of my days
I believe in the man in the sky

When I go to sleep at night, you're always a part of my dream
Holding me tight, telling me everything I want to hear
So don't forget me baby, all you gotta do is call
You know how I feel about you, I can do anything at all
Let me help


If your child needs a daddy, I can help
It would sure do me good to do you good

'Cause I can't help falling in love with you
'Cause I can't help falling in love with youToday I passed you on the street
And my heart was at your feet
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

Somebody else stood by your side
And he looked so satisfied
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you

A memory from the past came slowly stealing
As I braced your arm and walked so close to you 
Oh heaven only knows how much I miss you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you
I can't stop loving you
I said  I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time


And I can't stop wanting you
I said It's useless to say, yes I did
So I'll just live my life
In dreams of yesterday


Those happy hours
All that we once knew
Though long ago
They still make me blue


They say that time
It heals a broken heart
But time has stood still
Since we've been apart


I can't stop loving you
So I've made up my mind, yes I did
To live in memory
Of such an lone-, lonely time

I can't stop loving you

Ha ha ha ha ha...
Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I'm with my baby
Well, it ain't no fun with the sun around
I get going when the sun goes down
And I'm with my baby


Well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And we're going to kiss some more
Who cares how many times we kiss
'Cause at a time like this, who keeps score 

Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby


Well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And we're going to kiss some more
Who cares how many times we kiss
'Cause at a time like this, who keeps score 


Well, I don't care if the sun don't shine
I get my loving in the evening time
When I meet my baby


And it don't matter if it's sleet or snow
The drive-in's cozy when the lights are low
And I'm with my baby
Makes no difference if the rain comes down
I don't notice when she's around
Oh boy, what a baby


Well, that's when we're going to kiss and kiss
And kiss and kiss
And we're going to kiss some more
Well, one kiss from my baby doll
Makes me hot, more, more, more, more

I want my share of love
It might as well be known
But I ain't thinking of one
Girl to love alone

That ain't the way it's gonna be
I'm on my own and I am free
And I've been satisfied 
So I don't wanna be tied 

Somebody's loving arms
Can sure be sweet I've found
But I want no one's arms
To ever hold me down

Once I get caught inside a net
I'm gonna run I bet
I'm gonna run and hide 
'Cause I don't wanna be tied 


I've seen lovers who were matched
They thought that love could stay
Once they cared and got attached
It seems that love just slipped away

Don't want no claims on me 
Don't want no chains that bind 
As anyone could see 
I say what's on my mind 

Well, there ain't nothing I conceal
I'm gonna play the field
The field of love is wide 
So I don't wanna be tied 

I don't want to, I don't want to
I don't want to let you know how much I want you
Don't come near me, I don't trust you
I don't trust the way you thrill me when I touch you


I was happy, free and easy
I could go around and do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to love you, but I do

I was happy, free and easy
I could go around and do the things that please me
I don't want to get tied down with a girl like you
I don't want to love you, but I do
I don't want to love you, but I do
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Feel so bad
Like a ball game on a rainy day
Yes, I got my rain check
Shake my head and walk away


Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I will

Sometimes I want to stay here
Then again I want to leave here
Sometimes I want to leave here
Then again I want to stay
Yes, I got my train fare
Pack my grip and ride away


Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Ooh people, that's the way I feel
Sometimes I think I won't
Then again I think I willYour lips, your eyes, your soft sweet sighs
I feel that I've known you forever
Your style, your touch, you're just too much
I feel that I've known you forever

I know that this never happened to me
Don't have to see any more than I see

Your face so rare, beyond compare
I feel that I've known you forever
And ever and ever
I hear the bells
Saying Christmas is near
They ring out to tell the world
That this is the season of cheer


I hear a choir
Singing sweetly somewhere
And a glow fills my heart
I'm at peace with the world
As the sound of their singing fills the air

Oh why can't every day be like Christmas
Why can't that feeling go on endlessly
For if every day could be just like Christmas
What a wonderful world this would be


I hear a child
Telling Santa what to bring
And the smile upon his tiny face
Is worth more to me than anything
I hear the bells
Saying Christmas is near

There must be lights burning brighter somewhere
Got to be birds flying higher in a sky more blue
If I can dream of a better land, where all my brothers walk hand in hand
Tell me why, oh why, oh why can't my dream come true  Oh why


There must be peace and understanding sometime
Strong wind of promise that will blow away the doubt and fear
If I can dream of a warmer sun, where hope keeps shining on everyone
Tell me why, oh why, oh why won't that sun appear 

We're lost in a cloud with too much rain

If I get home on Christmas day
I won't need soft words to say
I'll miss you and I can stay a while
You'll see it in my eyes and when I smile


If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day


Writing letters everyday
Never really seem to say
The way I feel deep in this heart of mine
Thought I'm half a world away
If we're patient and we pray
Know I'll get my chance with you this time




If I get home before midnight
While you're still sleeping tight
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas day
I'll take you in my arms and there you'll stay
If I get home on Christmas dayNoneIf I loved you
Words wouldn't come in an easy way
Round in circles I'd go
Only to tell you
But afraid and shy
I let my golden chances pass me by

Soon you'll leave me
Ought  you would go in a misty day
Never, never let you know
I love you eternally
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be


They're saying I am just your clown
And any fool could see
That you're just having fun
And you're not in love with me


The things they're saying may be true
But there's something they can't see
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be

If I'm a dreamer, let me dream
If I'm your clown I'll steal the show
If things are not the way they seem
Please don't ever let me know


If I am blind it's because
I just don't want to see
If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be






If I'm a fool for loving you
Then that's just what I want to be
If I'm a fool for loving you
The Sandman comes to my house late each night
But it's way in the morning before he turns out my life
It's times like this my darling I can see
If I were you I'd know that I love me

The great snowman I've been called by all
But it looks like this time I'm going to fall
It's times like this my darling I can see
Ooh If I were you I'd know that I love me

Wind and rain and storm closing in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
Ooh If I were you I'd know that I love me


Wind and rain and storm closing in on me
I've walked the streets alone with my self sympathy
Can you hear me saying hopefully
If I were you I'd know that I love me
Ooh If I were you I'd know that I love me
If I were you I'd know that I love me
I forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time


The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
But something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget

The day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we ever met
Well, but something sure is wrong
'Cause I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forget
He left the splendor of heaven
Knowing His destiny
Was the lonely hill of Golgotha
There to lay down His life for me


And if that isn't love
Then the ocean is dry
There's no stars in the sky
And the little sparrows can't fly
Yeah if that isn't love
Then heaven's a myth
There's no feeling like this
If that isn't love


Even in death He remembered
The thief hanging by His side
Then he spoke of love and compassion
And He took him to paradise



It's got to be loveI don't know just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side
When I was drifting

And I was wondering

When Jesus found me

He heard me praying

And now I'm singing

Because I'm happy

And I don't know

Just what I'd do
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side


What would I do

What would I do

Well I'd be lonely, discouraged
Burdened on the way
If the Lord wasn't walking by my side every day

Soon we'll come to the end of life's journey
And perhaps never meet anymore
Till we gather in heaven's bright city
Far away on that beautiful shore


If we never meet again this side of heaven
As we struggle through this world and its strife
There's another meeting place somewhere in heaven
By the side of the river of life

Where the charming roses bloom forever 
And where separations come no more 
If we never meet again this side of heaven
I will meet you on that beautiful shore
Woke up early in the morning
What did the poor boy find 
Well, the car was gone and you were gone
And I almost lost my mind


If you don't come back

Yeah, if you don't come back today

You can call up the people at the crazy house
And take this crazy man away

Threw himself up against a stone wall
He tore his clothes at us all
Well, I ran out on the street in my stockinged feet
Tell the police I've been robbed




Mrs. Brown's been talking about me
To the people across the street
She said, "I cooked that boy a bucket of stew
But the poor thing just won't eat"


You came when I was happy in your sunshine
I grew to love you more each passing day
Before too long I'd filled my world around you
Yeah and I prayed you loved enough of me to stay


If you love me let me know
If you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be
If you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you

The arms that open wide to hold me closer
The hands that run their fingers through my hair
The smile that says hello it's good to see you
Any time I turn around and find you there


It's this and so much more that makes me love you
What else can I do to make you see
You know you'll have whatever's mine to give you
Yeah but a love affair for one it can never be


If you love me let me know
If you don't let me go
I can't take another minute of the day without you near
If you love me let it be
If you don't set me free
Take the chains away that keep me loving you


Take the chains away that keep me loving you
I know you're a lonely woman and I love you
But someone else is waiting and he owns you
If he should ever wake up, make sure that your story is straight love
If you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
And if you walk in your sleep forget where you came


Walking every night here in the shadows
So afraid that sometime he may follow
There's always the chance he'll find us
I don't need to remind you
If you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
If you walk in your sleep forget where you came

Love is so much sweeter when it's borrowed
I'll feel a little easier tomorrow
Don't give our secret away, be careful what you say
If you talk in your sleep don't mention my name
If you walk in your sleep forget where you came


Forget where you came, now
Forget where you came
Don't mention my name
Don't mention my name
Forget where you came
If you think I don't need you
Then take a look in my eyes
Maybe these ain't raindrops
Falling out of the sky
Since you been gone
I've been so alone
If you think I don't need you
Then baby you're wrong


If you think I don't love you
What could I do to prove to you baby
My love is true
I sing the same old song
Since you've been gone
If you think I don't love you
Then baby you're wrong

My life ain't been the same since you left me
I ain't had a wink of sleep in seven days
I don't know what to do I'm going crazy
I just walk the floor at night and call your name


If you think I don't do right
I'll change my ways
I'll do like you want me to, I'll be your slave
Since you been gone
I've been so alone
If you think I don't need you
Well baby you're wrong

I've got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby
Since a long time ago

And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
Cause it's gonna be hard to do


I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about loving you


Ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you about
In the palm of her hand

And then she starts to thinking
Then maybe she's put you in a blind
She'll give you just a little lovin'
It'll drive you out of your mind

Well, I've got a woman way across town
She's good to me, oh yeah

I got a woman way over town
Good to me, oh yeah
Never found a four leaf clover
To bring good luck to me
No rabbit's foot, no lucky star
No magic wishing tree

But I got lucky, yes, I got lucky

When I found you, oh oh, yeah


Got no rainbow around my shoulder
No horseshoe on my door
But I got you to hold me tight
And who could ask for more


Oh, I got lucky, yes, I got lucky

When I found you



I always walk around
With all my fingers crossed
I'm afraid the love I found
Just might get lost

Holy smoke
Land sakes alive!
I never thought this could happen to me

Uh huh, yeah
Uh huh, yeah


I got stung by a sweet honey bee
Oh, what a feeling come over me
It started in my eyes
Crept up to my head
Flew to my heart
'Til I was stung dead
I'm done, uh-uh
I got stung
Uh huh, yeah

She had all that I wanted and more
And I've seen honey bees before

Buzzing in my brain
Got stung all over
But I feel no pain
I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung


Now don't think I'm complaining
I'm mighty pleased we met
But you give one little peck
On the back of my neck
And I break out in a cold, cold sweat


Well, if I live to a hundred and two
I won't let nobody sting me but you
I'll be buzzing around your hive
Every day at five
And I'm never going to leave once I arrive
Because I'm done
Uh-uh, I got stung

Get up in the morning, feeling mighty weak
A-tossing and a-turning well, I ain't had no sleep
Oh baby, what road's our love taking 
To romance or heartbreaking
Won't you say which way you're gonna go
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know


Nine and nine make fourteen, four and four make nine
The clock is striking thirteen I think I lost my mind
You know it's getting aggravating
How long can I keep waiting 
Tell me if you love me, yes or no
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know


Oh, how much I need you
Have pity on this heart of mine
Well, if you need and want me too
I'll be your one and only till the end of time


Saw the fortune teller, had my fortune read
She sent me to the doctor, who sent me straight to bed
He said I'm lonesome and I'm lovesick
I've got my mind on lipstick
Will you kiss away my cares and woe 
I gotta know, gotta know, gotta know
Our little girl had taken sick one evening
As she walked home from shcool
And then her deathbed soon claimed her
It made us so sad and so blue

Then she called me close to her bedside
And whispered these words soft and low
Tell mommy to come to me quickly
I want to kiss you both and go

I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry
Take care of little brother
Tell him I'm gone to rest
I know his little heart is broken
He's all that you have left

Then she closed eyes forever
Never to see us no more
Until we meet our darlin
On that bright and peaceful shore

I hear a sweet voice calling
Way up in Heaven on high
God has made room for your daughter
Oh mommy and daddy dont cry

Three gates in the east

Three gates in the west

Three gates in the north

Three gates in the south
And that makes twelve gates to the city
All square wide
Hallelujah, got to mighty move



Well John declared that he saw a man
He held twelve bright stars in his right hand
Well his eyes flashed fire like the burning sun
Old John got scared and wanted to run
Well he wanted to run but his feet wouldn't go
Cause he felt the gospel cutting like a two-edged sword
And he heard a voice that said John, you take a look
And read what you see and then you write it in a book

And he saw twelve angels in the east
And there were twelve angels in the west
Hallelujah, brother
Twelve angels in the north
Twelve angels in the south
That's a total of forty-eight angels to the city
Four squared wide
Hallelujah, got to mighty move

I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin'
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes


I just can't help believin'
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats
With the rhythm of her sighs

This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day


Well, I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove


And I just can't help believin'
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining
Honey-sweet with love


This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day


Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ahh-ahh
For more than just a day

Sing the song baby

One more time

And one more

For more than just a day




I just can't help believin'
When she smiles up soft and gentle
With a trace of misty mornin'
And a promise of tomorrow in her eyes


I just can't help believin'
When she's lying close beside me
And my heart beats
With the rhythm of her sighs

This time the girl is gonna stay
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day


Well, I just can't help believin'
When she slips her hand in my hand
And it feels so small and helpless
And my fingers fold around it like a glove


And I just can't help believin'
When she's whispering her magic
And her tears are shining
Honey-sweet with love


This time the girl is gonna stay 
This time the girl is gonna stay
For more than just a day


Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ah-ahh-ah
Ahh-ahh
For more than just a day

Sing the song baby

One more time

And one more

For more than just a day
I need Jesus to guide me every day
As I'm travellin' along this rough and narrow way
Though afflictions fill my soul
I'm determined to make the goal
I've gotta have Jesus 'cause I just can't make it by myself

Every day I pray  pray 
Pray  pray 
I pray  pray (pray
Pray pray pray
Pray and ask the Lord Jesus
Don't leave me by myself
Every mornin' through the years I pray
You know I've got to have Jesus
I just can't it by myself
By myself
All right


Well, I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
Like a homesick train on a one-way track
I got to travel and hit the gravel
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back

Well, I'll return, I shall return
Don't cool those lips, we're gonna see them burn
Cause I'll be missing your kind of kissing
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back


Yeah, there ain't nobody to tell me stay or go, oh no
And no one tells the four winds where to blow
I'll be back, I'm coming back
Don't throw away that welcome mat


The door I'm hoping, will still be open a teeny weenie crack
To your shack
So keep that love light burnin'
But I'll be back, yeah, I'll be back
I'll be home for Christmas
You can plan on me
Please have snow and mistletoe
And presents for the tree

Christmas Eve will find me
Where the love light leads
I'll be home for Christmas, oh yes
If only in my dreams


On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
But if I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'll be home on Christmas day


And so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears fell
My soul fills with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day

Every time I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And I'd be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day


If I had any sense at all
I'd just be on my way
I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day
I said I'd catch that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day
On the hills of Georgia
Across the plains of Tennessee
I've seen, and I've done most everything
That a man can do or see
If I could only borrow one dream from yesterday
I'd be on that train tomorrow
I'd be home on Christmas day


It s been so many times before
She left that candle burning
Oh, too many tears that fell
My soul fill with yearning
If I had sense at all
I'd just be on my way
Be on that train tomorrow
Be home on Christmas day


Every time I think about her
All the love I left behind
Memories still linger, oh,  in my troubled mind
I could set aside my pride
And just be on my way
I'd be on that train tomorrow
And be home on Christmas day

I'll be there when all your dreams are broken
To answer your unspoken prayer, oh
When the little things you're doing, ooh, don't turn out right

I thought I knew the score
Now you've treated me so wrong
I can't take any more

And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
Fall in love, I'm never gonna fall in love
I mean it, I mean it, fall in love again

I gave my heart so easily, cast aside my pride
When I saw you in his arms baby
I broke up and cried

And it looks like I'm never gonna fall in love again
That's what I'm saying Fall in love, No, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me fall in love again

That's why I, no, I'm never gonna fall in love
Please don't make me, don't make me, fall in love again
How many stars are in the sky
I'll never know
What fire lights a firefly
I'll never know


What happens to this heart of mine
Each time you hold my hand
Sometimes the things we love the most
We never understand

I never thought these eyes would see
An angel's glow
What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know






What miracle brought you to me
I'll never know
I'll never let you go, little darling
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry
I'll never let you go, 'cause I love you
So please don't ever say goodbye


The stars would tumble down beside me
The moon would hang its head and cry
My arms would never hold another baby doll
If we should ever say goodbye

Well, I'll never let you go
Because I love you, pretty baby
I'm so sorry 'cause I made you cry, I made you cry
Yeah, I'll never let you go
'Cause I love you, little baby
So please don't ever say goodbyeIf you found someone new who means more than me to you
I'd never stand in your way
If you feel we must part, don't let pity rule your heart
I'll never stand in your way

I love you much too much to ever lose you
But what is to be will be and I'll obey
I'll be blue when you go but I'll never let it show
I'd never stand in your way

Living only to remember you

Some people think that pot of gold
Is all they ever want to hold
But there's a treasure, I think more of
Measure for measure  I'll take love


Some people think that their success
Is all they need for happiness
But there's a pleasure, I think more of
Measure for measure  I'll take love

Pound for pound oh yeah and
Ounce for ounce love is all that really counts
So let them have their wealth and fame
Eat caviar and drink champagne
You're all the treasure I'm dreaming of
Measure for measure  I'll take love

I'll take you home again, Kathleen
Across the ocean wild and wide
To where your heart has ever been
Since first, you were my bonny bride


The roses all have left your cheek
I watch them fade away and die
Your voice is soft whenever you speak
And tears bedim your lovely eye


Oh, I will take you home, Kathleen
To where your heart shall feel no pain
And when the fields are soft and green
I will take you to your home, Kathleen
Oh, I love only one girl, the one I got my arms around
I love only one girl, one in every town


In Paris there is Mimi, and when the moon is bright
I love to take her walking, along the Seine each night
I kiss her on the left bank, then I kiss her on the right



I'm proud of my Brunhilde, in Frankfurt on the Rhine
Oh she's a lot of woman and all of her is mine
Oh she can lift a Steinway as easy as a stein




In Naples there's Maria how she can cook and flirt
You can't beat her lasagna, I eat until I hurt
And then she tops it off with "amore" for dessert


I love you because you understand, dear
Every single thing I try to do
You're always there to lend a helping hand, dear
I love you most of all because you're you


No matter what the world may say about me
I know your love will always see me through
I love you for the way you never doubt me
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you

No matter what may be the style or season
I know your heart will always be true
I love you for a hundred thousand reasons
But most of all I love you 'cause you're youBuild it up, knock it down
Hold it square, roll it around
Throw it in the air
Stick it in the ground
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
'Cause I'm a roustabout

Tie it loose, make it tight
If it's wrong, do it right
Makes me kinda feel
Like I wanna fight
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
'Cause I'm a roustabout

Orders all day and half the night from the boss
That guy just doesn't wanna see one minute lost

Stack it up, in the rear
Better still bring it here
Wanna take it out, stick it in his ear
But it's too bad, I can't get mad
'Cause I'm a roustabout

A handyman is all I am around this place
Every time I turn around, he's right up in my face
I'm beginning to forget you
That old heartache is gone
I'm beginning to sleep at night
No more crying 'till dawn
I can hear your name mentioned
And it brings no misery
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me

I'm beginning to smile again
After crying for so long
I can hear the tune we loved so well
And it's just another song
I'm so happy that it's over
I'm so thankful to be free
I'm beginnin to forget you
Like you forgot me
Well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
And you get more lonely with each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting there and dreaming of
That girl a thousand miles away


Yes, it's still lonely having just her picture here with me
And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm gonna leave right now and go back where I ought to be
Going home to the girl that I adore

Well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love
And you get more lonely with each passing day
It's so lonely just sitting there and thinking of
That girl a thousand miles away


Well, every time I hear her sweet voice on the telephone
Then I know I just can't stand it another day
I'm gonna call right back and tell her that I'm coming home
Call her back and say I'm coming home to stay
Call her back and say I'm coming home to stay
Well, it's so very hard to have to leave the one you love

It's so lonely just sittin' there and dreamin' of
That girl a thousand miles away

And I know I just can't stand it anymore
I'm gonna leave right now and go back where I oughta be
Goin' home to the girl I adore

I'm gonna call right back and tell her that I'm comin' home
Call her back and say I'm comin' home to stay
Call her back and say I'm comin' home to stay
All the words that I let her know
Still could not say
How much I need you so
In every way
I will hope you will guide me
And only you can do
Hold my hands down beside me
I'm counting on you


I'm counting on you, dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through, dear
In your kind loving way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you

I'm counting on you, dear
From the dawn of each day
To always come through, dear
In your kind loving way
If you knew just how deeply
I feel things you do
Then you'll know how completely
I'm counting on you
I told you that someday
If you kept on being untrue
Somebody else would come along
And release me from you
You'll be glad to know now
Your fickle heart can have its own way
For it finally happened
I've met her today


I used to think I just couldn't live
A day without you
In spite of the thousand doubts and tears
That you put me through
All at once I don't care as much for you
I'm sorry to say
For now, there's another
I met her today

How I treasured each smile, each kiss
You gave to me now and then
Well, you needn't be kind to me now
Oh no, not ever again


Just when the last bit of pride in me was gone
Someone heard me pray
And sent me an angel
I met her today


I met her today
I'm falling in love tonight
Somehow I know
The beautiful world tonight
Is sharing its glow


When love let me down before
I said I was through
But I'm falling in love tonight
With you


'Til you walked by
I laughed and played the game
One kiss, then goodbye
And out went the flame


But somehow you've changed me, dear
This time it's true
I'm falling in love tonight
With youI'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
I'm gonna sit right down and cry over you
And if you ever say good-bye
If you ever even try

I'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'Cause I know my Jesus answers all my prayers
Well, well I know when He calls me to my home on high
I'll walk dem golden stairs when I die, when I die


Oh Lord, you know I can hardly wait
To reach that suite by and by, by and by
And now I see those pearly gates
I'll walk dem golden stairs when I die, when I die

Well, well, well
I'm gonna walk, walk dem golden stairs
'Cause I know my Jesus answers all my prayers
Well, well I know when He calls me to my home on high
I'll walk dem golden stairs when I die, when I die


When Jesus says to me, "Well done"
And all my cares are laid by
I'll lay down my soul, my battles are all won
I'll walk dem golden stairs when I die when I die


Well, well, well

Well, well I know when He calls me to my home on high
I'll walk dem golden stairs when I die, when I die
Still I recall all the good times together
The love we shared, the fun and the laughter
How I wish you could feel what my heart says tonight dear
I miss you and I wish you were here


Dreams that I had they lay broken in sorrow
The plans I made the hopes for tomorrow
If I could I would tell you I'm lonesome tonight dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here

All through the night I will see memories passing
The way you looked the sound of your laughing
How I long for the touch of your hand holding mine dear
Oh I miss you and I wish you were here


Lord, I miss you and I wish you were here
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la


Oh well I know
If I'd arrived in time to know you
If you had taken the time to show me
I wouldn't be lonely

Where will I go
Who will I have to lie beside me
To ease this emptiness inside me
I'm so lonely


Tried so hard each time, each time I just can't make it
Feelin' fast vibrations and I just can't take it
Living from day to day, chasing the dream
I'm, I'm leavin'

La la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la


Tried so hard each time, each time I just can't make it
Feelin' fast vibrations and I just can't take it
Living from day to day, chasing the dream

I'm, I'm leavin'
None
Well, you're right, I'm left, she's gone
You're right, and I'm left all alone
Well, you tried to tell me so
But how was I to know
That she was not the one for me 

You told me all along
You're right, our love was so wrong
But now I changed my mind
Because she broke the ties that bind
And I know that she never cared for me

Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do
I guess I'm not so smart
Oh, you tried to tell me along
She'd only break my heart
I'm left, you're right, she's gone
You're right, and I'm left all alone


Well, she's gone I know not where
But now I just don't care
For now I'm falling for you

If you'll forgive me now
I'll make it up somehow
So happy we will be
In a home just for three
And I'll soon forget her
Now I know


Well, I thought I knew just what she'd do
I guess I'm not so smart
You tried to tell me all along
She'd only break my heart

That big eight-wheeler runnin' down the track
Mean your true lovin' Daddy ain't comin' back
'Cause he's Moving on, he's rolling on
You were flying' too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving' on


But some day, baby, when you've had your play
Your gonna want your daddy but your daddy will say
Keep moving on, keep rolling on
You were flying too high for my little old sky
So I'm moving on, move on, baby


Mr. Fireman, won't you please listen to me 
'Cause I gotta pretty momma in Tennessee
To keep rolling on, keep moving on
Please listen to me, let this rattler free
Keep moving on, move on, son, move on


Well, I told you, baby, from time to time
But you just wouldn't listen or pay me no mind
And now I'm moving on, I'm rolling on
I'm through with you, too bad you're blue
But I'm moving on, move on, baby, move on

Show me a girl with a dimple on her cheek
But it melts in her mouth when she opens it to speak
Show me a girl who is acting so refined
And I'll show you a girl with one thing on her mind


So I say, "You know what "
She says, "What ", I say, "What 
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"

"For you've got what it takes
And it takes what you've got
But I'm not the marrying kind"


Don't kiss me, claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
I won't leave my freedom behind


So I say, "You know what "
She says, "What ", I say, "What 
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"


"You know what ", She says, "What "
I say, "What  Thanks a lot
But I'm not the marrying kind"


Don't kiss me, don't claw me
Don't pet me, don't paw me
I won't leave my freedom behind


So I say, "You know what "
She says, "What ", I say, "What 
Oh, I'm not the marrying kind"

Hear that lonesome whip-poor-will
He sounds too blue to fly
The midnight train is whining low
I'm so lonesome I could cry


Did you ever see a robin weep
When leaves began to die
That means he's lost the will to live
I'm so lonesome I could cry

The silence of a falling star
Lights up a purple sky
And as I wonder where you are
I'm so lonesome I could cry
I'm so lonesome I could cry
My love I offer you now
My heart and all it can give
For just as long as I live
I'm yours

No arms but yours, dear, will do
My lips will always be true
My eyes can see only you
I'm yours


And as the years roll along
Your joy, your tears, I'll gladly share
And when things go wrong, dear
Just hold out your hand and I'll be there


With every beat of my heart
With every breath that I take
Now and forever, sweetheart
I'm yours


And as the years roll on
Your joy and tears, I'll gladly share
And when things go wrong, dear
Just hold out your hand and I'll be there

Our friends all ask me
The last time I saw you
And I smile and tell them
It's been a day or two


There's no way to explain it
The way that I miss you
And my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue


I talk to your picture
My favorite one of you
I wish that you were here with me
But what good will it do


Having no way to tell you
The pain that I've been through
Oh, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
Yes, my love, you have left me
Indescribably blue
I need somebody to lean on
I need somebody to, to tell my troubles to
No use denying, I'm close to crying
But what good, tell me, what good would my crying do 


I need somebody to help me
Help me forget all those worries on my mind
And when I'm lonely, if someone would only
Want to be sweet and kind


I need somebody, won't that somebody
Please, please listen to my plea 
Need that somebody, won't that somebody
Come running to me 


I need somebody to lean on
I'm tired of being unhappy and so blue
If she came I would hold her
'Cause I need that shoulder to lean on, yes, I really do
I need somebody and maybe that somebody is you
Oh oh, I love you so
Uh uh, can't let you go
Ooh ooh, don't tell me no
I need your love tonight


Oh gee, the way you kiss
Sweetie, too good to miss
Wow-whee, want more of this
I need your love tonight


I've been waiting just for tonight
To do some lovin' and hold you tight
Don't tell me baby you gotta go
I got the hi-fi high and the lights down low


Hey now, hear what I say
Oh wow, you better stay
Pow pow, don't run away
I need your love tonight, yeah

I need your love tonight
I need your love tonight

I need you so 
To keep me happy
If I can't have you
I cannot go on 

I need your arms 
Around me tightly
Yes, I miss them nightly
When you're not at home 


When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock upon the door 


When you leave me 
I try not to worry
Come back in a hurry 
'Cause I need you so 


When the day is done
I miss you so
I lie and wait
To hear you knock upon the door 

Baby don't fall in love with me
I'll only bring you grief
Baby, don't set your heart on me
I'll only have to leave


Because the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind

Daddy, he was a traveling man
I hardly knew his face
Momma, she cried for him at night
He never stayed in one place




Oh I can't give you the love you need
I just won't be here that long
But if you still want me here tonight
I'll love you till the break of dawn


Because the north wind flows through my veins
Like my dad there's a dream in my brain
In the morning I'll have to leave again
That's how it is when you inherit the wind
Inherit the wind
Inherit the wind, inherit the wind
In my father's house are many mansions
If it were not true he would have told me so
He has gone away to live in that bright city
He's preparing me a mansion there I know


Jesus died upon the cross to bear my sorrow
Freely died that souls like you might have new life
But I know that soon there'll come a bright tomorrow
When the world will all be free from sin and strife



In my father's house are many mansions
If you're true then to this land you'll surely go
I may not be here tomorrow
But I'm close beside you today
So lie to me a little, say you love me a lot
And I'll be true to you in my way


Love never goes on forever
At least that's what wise men all say
So smile when you kiss me, tomorrow you may cry
But I'll be true to you in my way
Yes, I'll be true to you in my way
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


He speaks and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known
I come to the garden alone
While the dew is still on the roses
And the voice I hear falling on my ear
The Son of God discloses


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever known


He speaks and the sound of his voice
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing
And the melody that he gave to me
Within my heart is ringing


And he walks with me
And he talks with me
And he tells me I am his own
And the joy we share as we tarry there
None other has ever knownWhen the shit flies
*Laughs at his own joke for 2 minutes*
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto 
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto 
People, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way 


Well, the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto 
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto

As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago morning
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another little hungry mouth to feed

And look the other way

Well the world turns
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto


And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal
And he learns how to fight
In the ghetto





Then one night in desperation
A young man breaks away
He buys a gun, He steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries


As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto
As the snow flies
On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto
And his mama cries
'cause if there's one thing that she don't need

He buys a gun, steals a car
Tries to run, but he don't get far
And his mama cries

As a crowd gathers 'round an angry young man
Face down on the street with a gun in his hand
In the ghetto

On a cold and gray Chicago mornin'
Another little baby child is born
In the ghetto

A poor little baby child is born
In the ghetto 
And his mama cries
'Cause if there's one thing that she don't need
It's another hungry mouth to feed
In the ghetto 


Now people, don't you understand
A child needs a helping hand
Or he'll grow to be an angry young man some day
Now take a look at you and me
Are we too blind to see
Do we simply turn our heads
And look the other way 


Well, the world turns
You never stood in that man's shoes
Or saw things through his eyes
Or stood and watched him with helpless hands
While the heart inside you dies
So help your brother along the way
No matter where he starts
For the same God that made you
Made him too
These men with broken hearts
And his mama cries
And a hungry little boy with a runny nose
Plays in the street as the cold wind blows
In the ghetto
And his hunger burns
So he starts to roam the streets at night
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight
In the ghetto
Oh, the way I feel tonight
You better wrap me up good and tight
In your arms 
In your arms 


Just like a bee in a honeycomb
I'm gonna make myself right at home
In your arms 
In your arms 


Well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied
Just a little bit of loving, that's bonafide
In your arms keep me tangled up all the time
Like a kitten with a ball of twine


Yeah baby, that's where I wanna stay
For the rest of my natural days
In your arms 
In your arms 


Well, it don't take much to keep me satisfied
Just a little bit of loving that's bonafide
In your arms keep me tangled up all the time
Like a kitten with a ball of twine

Oh how many arms have held you
And hated to let you go
How many, oh how many, I wonder
But I really don't want, I don't want to know


Oh how many lips have kissed you
And set, set your soul aglow, yes they did
How many, oh how many, I wonder, yes I do
But I really don't want to know


So always make, make me wonder
And always make, make me guess
And even, you know even if I ask you
Oh darling oh don't you, don't confess


Just let it, let it remain your secret
Oh for darling, darling I love you so
No wonder, yeah no wonder, I wonder
Mm, 'cause I really don't want, I don't want to know
They say everything can be replaced
They say every distance is not near
So I remember every face
Of every man who put me here


I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released

They say every man needs protection
They say that every man must fall
Yet I swear I see my reflection
Somewhere so high above this wall


I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be released


Now yonder stands a man in this lonely crowd
A man who swears he's not to blame
All day long I hear him shouting so loud
Crying out that he was framed


I see my light come shining
From the west down to the east
Any day now, any day now
I shall be releasedWell Lordy I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's growin' in the meadow 
I shall not be moved

I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I will not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

Well I'm on my way to glory land and I shall not be moved
On my way to glory land I shall not be moved
I'm like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

Oh well
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
I shall not be, I shall not be moved
Just like a tree that's planted by the water
I shall not be moved

Oh, if you tell a lie
You know that I'll forgive you
Though you say our love is just a game
And when you hear my name
You'll say I'm from a strange world
But is it so strange to be in love with you


Is it so strange
That I love you more than all the world
Is it so strange
I have no eyes for any other girl

Oh, won't you take me back
And say that you still love me
To waste a love like ours would be a sin
Let us kiss again
Let me hold you near
And take me from this strange world
That I'm living in
Kauai, island of love
Lovely princess of the islands
Kauai, island of love
Listen, can't you hear her calling
Aloha, welcome my love


Her palm trees gently do the hula
While her slaves, the waves
Rush in to kiss her shores
Heaven is another name for
Kauai, island of love

Heaven is another name for
Kauai, island of love
Kauai, island of love
Kauai, island of love
I look at you and, wham, I'm head over heels
I guess that love is a banana peel
I feel so bad and yet I'm feeling so well
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell


One crazy kiss and, bam, I head for the skies
I guess that love is like a cake of ice
You skate along, but then you can never tell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell


I never thought I'd get kicked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy, I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks


My knees are weak, my head is spinning around
I guess that love has turned me upside down
Thought I'd get hurt, but gee, it's turning out swell
I slipped, I stumbled, I fell


I never thought I'd get kicked by your sweet talking lies
You got a bag of tricks
And when you got busy, I got dazzled and dizzy
I fell like a ton of bricks

You're losing interest in me and it's showing
It is no big thing but it's growing
The pain of heartbreak I've just started knowing
Well, it is no big thing but it's growing

 
Well every day the hurt grows bigger than before
But I'll pretend I don't know this
Well, if I can hold you one day more
You've got the look of someone who's going
Well, you're going to leave me and it's showing
A little tear I can feel start to flow
Well it is no big thing but it's growing
No, it is no big thing but it's growing
Step in these arms
Where you belong
It feels so right, so right
How can it be wrong 

There's something in the way you kiss
That makes me wanna hold you tight
I know that nothing can be wrong
That feels so right, oh yeah


Each time we touch
You thrill me so
It means so much, so much
I can't let you go, yeah

This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life through
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong 

This isn't only for tonight
We're gonna love our whole life long
'Cause baby, if it feels so right
How can it be wrong 
Oh, yeah
No one's in a hurry
No one seems to worry
Why they're all so happy is very clear
Every day siesta, every night fiesta
I think I'm gonna like it here


All this lovely scenery
There's more to it than greenery
You know a chance for romance is always near
Mission bells are ringing, everybody's singing
I think I'm gonna like it here

The sound of laughter from every doorway
Sweet music floating across the square
It seems to say things are going your way
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air


Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier
I don't care where we go, so lead on mi amigo
I think I'm gonna like it here


Melodias, lapieras
Your troubles like bubbles will soon disappear in the air


Down to my last peso, but I'm not afraid to say so
I feel just like a brave Spanish cavalier
I don't care where we go, so lead on  mi amigo
I think I'm gonna like it here
I think I'm gonna like it here
I think I'm gonna like it here
It hurts me to see him treat you the way that he does
It hurts me to see sit you and cry
When I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see those tears in your eyes


The whole town is talking, they're calling you a fool
For listening to his same old lies
And when I know I could be so true
If I had someone like you
It hurts me to see the way he makes you cry


You love him so much, you're too blind to see
He's only playing a game
He's never loved you
He never will
And, darling, don't you know he'll never change


I know that he never will set you free
Because he's just that kind of guy
But if you ever tell him you're through
I'll be waiting for you
Waiting to hold you so tight
Waiting to kiss you goodnight
Yes, darling, if I had someone like you
The chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you 

You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do


There is no night for in His light
You'll never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go

There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take Him at His promise
Don't run away and hide


It is no secret what God can do
What He's done for others, He'll do for you
With arms wide open, He'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
I cry myself to sleep each night
Wishing I could hold you tight
Life seems so empty since you went away
And the pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurting
Since you're gone


It keeps right on a'hurting every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone


They say a man ain't supposed to cry
But when I see you passing by
My heart breaks down and cries a million tears
The pillow where you lay your head
Now holds my empty dreams instead
And it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone


It keeps right on a'hurting every minute of the day
Every hour you're away I feel so lonely
And I can't help it, I don't think I can go on
And it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone
Yes, it keeps right on a-hurting since you're gone
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eating all the while


Eat, Ito eat all the night and the day
Everybody
Eat, Ito eat all the night and the day


Ito is an eating boy
He never get enough from fish and poi
He eat everything, he don't care what
He even eat the shell from the coconut


Eat, Ito eat all the night and the day
Eat, Ito eat all the night and the day

Hey, Ito little faster
Ito little slower


Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
Ito eat like teeth are out of style
When you say that, strangers smile
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
It's a long lonely highway when you're travelling all alone
And it's a mean old world when you got no-one to call your own
And you pass through towns too small to even have a name, oh yes
But you got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere
Got to keep on going, though there's no-one to care
Just keep moving down the line


It's a long lonely highway without her by my side
And it's a trail full of teardrops that keep on being cried
My heart's so heavy it's a low down dirty shame oh yes
You got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere
Got to keep on going, though there's no-one to care
Just keep moving down the line


I got to rock for my pillow beneath a weeping willow
And the cool grass for my bed


My drinking water's muddy so don't you tell me buddy
That I wouldn't be better off dead
It's a long lonely highway getting longer all the time
And if she don't come and get me
Well, I'm going to lose my mind
So if you read about me tell her she's the one to blame, oh yes
You got to keep on going, on that road to nowhere
Got to keep on going, though there's no-one to care
Just keep moving down the line
Moving down the line
Moving down the lineIt's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home

I have been way from her now for a long time
And I've lived a life I thought that it should be
It's a long, long way from now to maybe sometime
And the waiting round is really killing me

It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time oh Lord, before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again it's a matter of time
I think I'll take a train right early in the morning
Just to see how far I get along the way
But the trains don't run too often only sometimes
So I guess I'd better wait another day

It's a matter of time before I go back there
A matter of time before I go home
It's a long way I know and the goin' ain't easy
She'll see me again, it's just a matter of time
She'll see me I know it's a matter of time
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
Because I know our love could never be
It's a sin to keep this memory of you
When silence proves that you've forgotten me


The dreams I built for us has tumbled
Each promise broken like my heart
It's a sin, my darling, how I love you
So much in love and yet so far apart


I'm sure you're happy with another
Who shares the love I could not win
Why pretend that I can live without you
When deep inside I know that it's a sin 
Young as a circus parade, it's a wonderful world
Pretty as pink lemonade, it's a wonderful world
Life is a carnival, live it for all your worth
You are the star of the greatest show on Earth


This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow-colored balloon's dancing high overhead
It's everyone's oyster, step up, get your pearl
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world


This big wide world is a clown with his nose painted red
A rainbow-colored balloon's dancing high overhead
It's everyone's oyster, step up, get your pearl
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful world
It's a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful worldIt's been so long darling since I gazed into your eyes
It's been so long darling but now I realize
And just 'cos by seeing you it hurts me through and through
It's been so long darling that I'm back to you
Come on kids from eight to eighty
Hey there mister bring your lady
There's a big show on the inside
It's carnival time


Popcorn, peanuts, and cotton candy
Pink lemonade that's dan-dan-dandy
Be a big shot for a dollar
It's carnival time

Roustabouts roustabouting
And there's happy shouts, children shouting
If you've got doubts quit your doubtin'
There's thrills, it's spice
It's cheap at half the price
So don't be bashful, buy a ticket
Get the habit never kick it
Hit the band there, don't just stand there
It's carnival time
Roustabouts roustabouting

If you've got doubts quit your doubtin'
There's thrills, it's spice
It's cheap at half the price
So don't be bashful, buy a ticket
Get the habit never kick it
Hit the band there, don't just stand there
It's carnival timeLook at you and tell myself
How wonderful you are
You're so different now
To me you're much more wonderful, more wonderful by far
Yes, you're different now
There's more to love than holding hands and stealing kisses
No-one else around
There's the good times and the bad
There's the ups and downs we've had
But it's different now I'm so glad I still have you
There's always something new to see
I look at you, you look at me
And we're so different now
Love gets better every day 'n in some peculiar way
It's always different now
If we ever say goodbye, you'd be lost
And so would I, what's the difference now between us
Love just for a day, and a love that's here to stay
That's the difference now, the difference now
You may not mind that it's over
But I've a different point of view
Even though I am shattered
It's easy for you


You don't have to face the music
You don't have to face the crowd
Just go back where you came from
You ain't even proud

I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think I should say


I found it hard to leave them
Saddest thing I ever had to do
My problems haven't started
And it's easy for you


I had a wife and I had children
I threw them all away
And now you tell me, you dare to tell me
I should go back to them
What do you think, what on earth do you think I should say


If you ever tire of the good life
Call me in a year or two
I've got no choice, I'll forgive you
'Cause it's easy for you

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky
It's just impossible
It's impossible to ask a baby not to cry
It's just impossible
Can I hold you closer to me
And not feel you going through me 
But the second that I never think of you
Oh, how impossible


Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore 
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more 
It's just impossible
And tomorrow should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible


Can the ocean keep from rushing to the shore 
It's just impossible
If I had you, could I ever ask for more 
It's just impossible
And tomorrow should you ask me for the world
Somehow I'd get it, I would sell my very soul
And not regret it for to live without your love
Is just impossible
Oh, impossible

Impossible
Maybe it's too late
Sometimes even hate myself
For loving you


Trying to be strong
Then nighttime comes along
And I start loving you, wanting you
Where is all my self-control 
I'm burning way down in my soul
And needing you
Wishing I could be the man I try to
Hating me for wanting to be with you
Knowing you don't love me like you used to
But it's midnight, oh, and I miss you


It's getting late and I know
That's when I am weak
Funny how things have a way
Of looking so much brighter in the daylight


I hope to go to bed
And try to straighten out my head
And just forget you
Oh, but it's midnight and I miss you
It's no fun being lonely
...
Morning must come
Knowing, knowing there's no one for me
.....

Knowing, knowing there's no one waiting for meThe chimes of time ring out the news
Another day is through
Someone slipped and fell
Was that someone you 

You may have longed for added strength
Your courage to renew
Do not be disheartened
For I have news for you

It is no secret what God can do
What he's done for others, he'll do for you
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do

There is no night for in his light
You never walk alone
Always feel at home
Wherever you may go

There is no power can conquer you
While God is on your side
Take him at his promise
Don't run away and hide

It is no secret what God can do
What he's done for others, he'll do for you
With arms wide open, he'll pardon you
It is no secret what God can do
It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow
Will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait


When I first saw you
With your smile so tender
My heart was captured
My soul surrendered
I spent a lifetime
Waiting for the right time
Now that you're near
The time is here at last

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow
Will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait


Just like a willow
We would cry an ocean
If we lost true love
And sweet devotion
Your lips excite me
Let your arms invite me
For who knows when
We'll meet again this way


It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me, my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow
Will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

It's now or never
Come hold me tight
Kiss me my darling
Be mine tonight
Tomorrow will be too late
It's now or never
My love won't wait

It's now or never
My love won't wait
It's now or never
My love won't wait
I see the sunlight in her hair
I feel the warm smile that she wears
She has no recipe for love
But I just can't get enough
From the distance of my mind
Clock that's ringing says it's time
Wake up to my destiny
It's time to face reality


It's only love that I feel inside
But I'll get by somehow
It's only love, there must be something else for me girl

I tell myself that it's not real
There's nothing left for me to feel
I'll just be going on my way
Tomorrow brings another day


It's only love that I feel inside
But I've got to be strong, my mind's hanging on
It's only love, but I know I'll get by
I'll take my heart and my pride, and just throw it aside
It's only love


It's only love, it's only love, it's only love
It's only love
It's only love
If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over


When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Now it's over


If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh, there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over

If time were not a moving thing
And I could make it stay
This hour of love we share
Would always be
There'd be no coming day
To shine a morning light
And make us realize our night is over


When you walk away from me
There is no place to put my hand
Except to shade my eyes against the sun
That rises over the land
I watch you walk away
Somehow I have to let you go
Because it's over


If you knew just how I really feel
You might return and yet
There are so many times
That people have to love and then forget
Oh there might have been a way somehow
I have to force myself to say
It's over

The day you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
You had the nerve to tell me I would soon forget
Now you've been gone away one year
And I have not forgotten, dear
The love I had for you so long
Is still here
Wow-oh


It's here, still here
Because my heart cannot believe
We're really through
And though you said we'd never part
You turned around and broke my heart
The love I had for you so long
Is still here

 
You offered me a penny for my thoughts
And I told you then that woman won't stay caught
But you turned and loved her anyway
She broke your heart and all I've got to say


It's your baby, you rock it
It's your heartache, you bought it
You made the bed you sleeping in
And I'm tired of hearing about it friend
It's your baby, you rock it

Well you cried upon my shoulder like a baby
I'm sorry 'bout your troubles and your lady
But she done you like she done me
And I've used up all my sympathy
It's your baby you, rock it


The shooting stars are coming out of your eyes
They point the way, the way to paradise
I got a funny feeling, I can't be wrong
It won't be long until the sparks will fly
It won't be long


I hear a buzz, buzz around in my brain
But what it does, is bound to drive me insane
At a time like this I must be strong
It won't be long till the sky falls down
It won't be long

Love has taught me plenty, I'm still learning more
Anything worth having is worth the waiting for
Here I go, I'm on a one way trip
Look out below because I'm about to flip
I tell you when these lips get to that kiss


It won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long




It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
It won't be long, it won't be long until we're out of this world
It won't be long
Oh, it won't seem like Christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Well then I'll see you tonight in my dreams


Seems a long time since we've been together
It was just about to this time of the year
Looks like it's a-gonna be snowy weather
How I wish that you could be here


But it won't seem like Christmas, oh, without you
Far too many miles are between
But if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams


In the distance I hear sleigh bells ringing
The holly is so pretty this year
And the carol that somebody's singing
Reminds me of our Christmas last year


Oh, but it won't be like Christmas without you
Far too many miles are between
Oh, but if I get the one thing that I'm wishing for
Then I'll see you tonight in my dreams
I could wander the byway, rewander too
But it wouldn't be the same without you
Those familiar old places would just make me blue
'Cause it wouldn't be the same without you

I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without you

I wasted my love on a careless romance
But I'd do it again, if I had the chance
I could start my life over with somebody new
But it wouldn't be the same without youDo you remember the love we had for each other
I was your faithy...

I miss you so
Please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go, you know
Please understand just how I feel
Your love for me might not reveal
And if you know this time it's real
We understood 
I miss you so
Please believe me when I tell you
I just can't stand to see you go, you know
Please understand just how I feel
Come back to me, my love is real
And you will know this timeless feel
Will understand

Will understand Where, o where are you
Tell me where are you
Where are the nights we spent together
Where is your promise
That you will leave me never
I've been blue the whole day through
Where o where are you
I've got something to tell you
That I think you ought to know
That my eyes are on you baby
Since a long time ago
And now I finally got the nerve
And I'm gonna make my move
Now don't you try to turn me off
Cause it's gonna be hard to do


I've got a thing about you baby
Ain't nothing I can do
I've got a thing about you baby
A thing about loving you

Ain't it just like a woman
When she knows she's got a man
She'll wring you out and turn you about
In the palm of her hand
And then she starts to thinking
Then maybe she's put you in a blind
She'll give you just a little lovin'
It'll drive you out of your mind


When trouble is in my way
I can't tell the night from day
I toss from side to side
Like a ship on a raging tide
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet
Trouble's coming from time to time
But that's all right
Cause I'm not the worrying kind

Because I, I've got confidence
God is gonna see me through
No matter what the case may be
I know he's gonna fix it for me


Job was so sick so long
Till the flesh fell from his bones
His wife, cattle and children
Everything that he had was gone
But Job he never despaired
He knew that God still cared
Sleepless days and sleepless nights
Job said "Honey, that's all right"




Some folks wonder how I smile
Even though I'm going to trial
How can I have a song
Everything is going wrong
I don't worry and I don't fret
God has never failed me yet

I've got to find my baby
I wonder where can she be
Has anybody seen her
Send her back to me


She left me here all alone
And I ain't had no loving
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone


I've got to find my baby
I got to hold her tight and tell her I love her
Tell her everything's all right
So I'll keep searching
All night long
And I ain't had no loving
Since my baby's been gone
My baby's gone


I've got to find my baby
I've got to find my baby
Got to find my baby
Lying by your side I watch you sleeping
And in your face the sweetness of a child
Murmuring the dreams you won't recapture
Though it will haunt the corners of you mind


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling

Who can tell when summer turns to autumn
And who can point the moment love grows cold
Softly without pain the joy is over
Though why it's gone will neither of us know


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling, oh


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling


Six o'clock the baby will be crying
And you will stumble, sleeping to the door
In the chill and solemn gray of morning
We play the parts that we have learned too well


Oh, I've lost you yes, I've lost you
I can't reach you anymore
We ought to talk it over now
But reason can't stand in for feeling

There's no joy in my heart, only sorrow
And I'm sad as a man can be
I sit alone in the darkness of my lonely room
And this room is a prison to me


I look out my window
And what do I see 
I see a bird
Way up in a tree
I want to be free , free 
Free
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree 


Oh, what good are my eyes, they can't see you
And my arms, they can't hold you so tight
I have two lips that are yearning
But they're no good to me
'Cause I know I can't kiss you tonight


I look out my window
And what do I see 
I see a bird
Way up in a tree
I want to be free , free 
Free
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree 
I want to be free
Like a bird in a tree 
Hold me close, hold me tight
Make me thrill with delight
Let me know where I stand from the start


I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart


Every time that you're near
All my cares disappear
Darling, you're all that I'm living for

I want you, I need you, I love you
More and more


I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that I will go on
Loving you eternally


Won't you please be my own 
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart


I want you, I need you, I love you
With all my heart


Well, I thought I could live without romance
Until you came to me
But now I know that I will go
On loving you eternally


Won't you please be my own 
Never leave me alone
'Cause I die every time we're apart

When I was little my mama said to me
"Someday you'll find a love, son, to last eternally"
I want you with me

Everywhere I go

No, please don't leave me, baby, I love you so



I'll be the ruler of this whole wide world
If you will only say that you'll be my girl
I want you with me

In everything I do

Well, you know I need you, baby, I'm in love with you



There is no mountain that I can't climb
You find the mountain, child, and I will find the time
I want you with me

With me night and day

Well, you can make me happy, baby, don't you go away


I saw old pharaoh's daughter bring Moses from the water
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so


I was born about ten thousand years ago
There is nothing in this world that I don't know
I saved king David's life and he offered me a wife
I said now you're talking business have a chair


Yeah, I was born about ten thousand years ago
There is nothing in this world that I don't know
Saw Peter, Paul, and Moses playing ring around the roses
I'll lick the guy that says it isn't so

I was there when old Noah built the ark
And I crawled in the window after dark
I saw Jonah eat the whale and dance with the lion's tail
And I crossed over Canaan on a log

I was born in Macon Georgia
They kept my daddy over in Macon jail
He told me if you keep your hands clean
You won't hear them bloodhounds on your trail
Well I fell in with bad companions
Robbed a man, oh up in Tennessee
They caught me way up in Nashville
They locked me up and threw away the key

I washed my hands in muddy water
Washed my hands, but they didn't come clean
Tried to do what my daddy told me
But I must have washed my hands in a muddy stream


Well I asked the judge now when's my time up
He said son, oh you know we won't forget
If you try just to keep your hands clean
We might just make a good man of you yet

Oh I couldn't wait to get my time up
I broke out, broke out of Nashville jail
I just crossed the state-line of Georgia
Well I can hear those bloodhounds on my trail


I was the one who taught her to kiss
The way that she kisses you now
And you know the way she touches your cheek
Well, I taught her how


I was the one who taught her to cry
When she wants you under her spell
The sight of her tears drives you out of your mind
I taught her so well

And then one day, I had my love
As perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me


I'll never know who taught her to lie
Now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart 
I was the one


And then one day, I had my love
As perfect as could be
She lived, she loved, she laughed, she cried
And it was all for me


I'll never know who taught her to lie
Now that it's over and done
Who learned the lesson when she broke my heart 
I was the one
I will be home again
Don't worry, dear
I'll be home again
So won't you dry the tear 

The promise in your eyes
Will see me through
There'll be brighter skies
When I come back to you


Ahh sweetheart, the love you're giving
Thrills my hungry heart
You make my life worth the living
Although we are apart

I will be home again
We'll start anew
Darling, until then
Our dreams will have to do


Ahh sweetheart, the love you're giving
Thrills my hungry heart
You make my life worth the living
Although we are apart

I will be true
No matter what they may say
I will be true
Although you're far, far away


Each night I pray
All day I'll say silent prayers
That when I open my door
I'll find you there

Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true


Somehow I feel
That someday we'll meet again
Don't ask me how
It's something I can't explain
Until the day
I give up all hope of you
Assure yourself this, I'll do
I will be true
The warden threw a party in the county jail
The prison band was there and they began to wail
The band was jumping and the joint began to swing
You shoulda heard those knocked out jailbirds sing

You've got to walk that lonesome valley

You gotta go there by yourself

He wrote that holy holy bible
The bible tells you, it plainly tells you
That he was, that he was a preacher too
Jingle bell

Jingle bell rock

Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring
Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun
Now the jingle hop has begun

Jingle bell
Jingle bell
Jingle bell rock
Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time
Dancing and prancing in Jingle Bell Square
In the frosty air

What a bright time, it's the right time
To rock the night away
Jingle bell time is a swell time
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh
Giddy-up jingle horse, pick up your feet
Jingle around the clock
Mix and a-mingle in the jingling feet

That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell
That's the jingle bell rock
Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
Stood a log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play the guitar just like ringing a bell


Go, go, go Johnny go, go, go Johnny, go go
Go Johnny go, go, go Johnny go go
Johnny B. Goode


His mama told him "someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader of a big band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear your playing music when the sun goes down
Maybe someday you will be in lights saying Johnny B. Goode"

God knows that Joshua fit the battle of Jericho

Good morning, sister Mary
Good morning, brother John
Well, I wanna stop and talk with you
And tell you how I come along

I know you've heard about Joshua
He was the son of Nun
He never stopped his work until
Until the work was done


God knows that Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
Jericho Jericho
Joshua fit the battle of Jericho
And the walls come tumbling down


You may talk about your men of Gideon
You may brag about your men of Saul
There's none like good old Joshua
At the battle of Jericho

Up to the walls of Jericho
He marched with spear in hand
"Go blow them ram horns," Joshua cried
"'Cause the battle is in my hands"

They say you found somebody new
Whose love will always be true
I don't know what it is to be alone
That's why I dread to know you're gone

Oh, Judy
Don't let our sweet love wither and die like flowers in the fall
Oh, Judy
Don't you know it's you I love most of all


Oh, please
Come back, I promise always to be true
Oh, Judy
There'll never be anyone else, dear, but you

Well then a little light from heaven healed my soul
Well, he bathed my heart in love, and wrote my name above
Well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna it right

We'll just have a little talk with Jesus
We're gonna tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our fainted cry
He will answer by and by
Oh well, when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
And you will know a little fire is burnin'
You will find a little talk with Jesus makes it right

You may have doubts and fears
Your eye be filled with tears
Oh well my Jesus is a friend who watches day and night
Well he wrote my name above, and he bathed my heart in love
Oh well just a little talk with my Jesus gonna make it right

Let us have a little talk with my Jesus
Please let us tell Him all about our troubles
He will hear our faintest cry
He will answer by and by
Now when you feel a little prayer wheel turning
You'll know just a little fire is burnin'
And have a little talk with my Jesus gonna makes it right

Well, well, well just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your momma thinks you're hot
Well, just because you think you've got something
That no other girl has got
You've caused me to spend all my money
You laughed and called me old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because



Well, well, well there'll come a time when you'll be lonesome
And there'll come a time when you'll be blue
Well, there'll come a time when old Santa
He won't pay your bills for you
You've caused me to lose all my women
And now, now you say we are through
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I was through with you
A long, long, long time ago




Well, just because you think you're so pretty
And just because your mama thinks you're the hottest thing in town
Well, just because you think you've got something
That nobody else has got
You've caused me to spend all of my money
Honey, you laughed and called me your old Santa Claus
Well, I'm telling you, baby, I'm through with you
Because, well well, just because
Why must I love a heartless woman
Who never knows the harm she's done
Though love is blind I should have known
Just call me lonesome from now on


I climb the stairs up to my room
But no-one greets me in my gloom
The silence tells me she is gone
Just call me lonesome from now on


These walls will hide me when I cry
I hope that heaven lets me die
What good is life when hope has gone
Just call me lonesome from now on


Just call me lonesome from now on
Just for old time sake
Won't you give my heart a break
Let's get together again
Let's relive the time
I was yours and you were mine
Life was so wonderful then


I know, now I know
The day I let you go
I made my greatest mistake
If you loved me then
You could love me once again
Won't you try just for old time sake

I know, yes I know
The day I let you go
I made my greatest mistake
If you loved me then
You could love me once again
Won't you try just for old time sakeNone
Just pretend, I'm holding you
And whispering things soft and low
And think of me, how it's going to be
Just pretend I didn't go


When I walked away, I heard you say
If you need me, you know what to do
If I knew it then, I'd be back again
So just pretend I'm right there with you

And I'll come flying to you, again
All my crying is true
Oh, I will hold you and love you again
But until then, we'll just pretend


Oh, it's funny but I can't recall
The things we said or why you're crying

I belong there by your side

She's sitting right over there
I'd know that face anywhere
I'd run up and embrace her
But I'm ashamed to face her
Just tell her Jim said hello

I'd like to pour out my heart
But I don't know where to start
I'd like to tell her
What I'm really feeling but
Just tell her Jim said hello

Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim and she'll know


Don't tell her I'm feeling blue
That's just between me and you
Don't say I'm thinking of her
Don't tell her I still love her
Just tell her Jim said hello


Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
Just tell her Jim said hello
Seven lonely days and a dozen towns ago
I reached out one night and you were gone
Don't know why you'd run, what you're running to or from
All I know is I want to bring you home


So, I'm walking in the rain, thumbing for a ride
On this lonely Kentucky backroad
I've loved you much too long, my love's too strong
To let you go, never knowing what went wrong


Kentucky rain keeps pouring down
And up ahead's another town that I'll go walking through
With the rain in my shoes 
Searching for you in the cold Kentucky rain
In the cold Kentucky rain


Showed your photograph to some old gray-bearded men
Sitting on a bench outside a general store
They said, "Yes, she's been here," but their memory wasn't clear
"Was it yesterday  No, wait, the day before"


I finally got a ride with a preacher man who asked
"Where you bound on such a cold, dark afternoon "
As we drove on thru the rain, as he listened, I explained
And he left me with a prayer that I'd find you

There's a man in New Orleans who plays rock and roll
He's a guitar man with a great big soul
He lays down a beat like a ton of coal
He goes by the name of King Creole


You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole


When the king starts to do it, it's as good as done
He holds his guitar like a tommy gun
He starts to growl from way down in his throat
He bends a string and that's all she wrote


You know he's gone, gone, gone
Jumping like a catfish on a pole, yeah
You know he's gone, gone, gone
Hip-shaking King Creole 


Well, he sings a song about a crawdad hole
He sings a song about a jelly roll
He sings a song about a-pork and greens
He sings some blues about New Orleans

A poor man wants the oyster
A rich man wants the pearl


But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world

The rich man wants the princess
The poor man just wants a girl



A poor man wants to be a rich man
A rich man wants to be a king


But the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Come on let's sing, sing brother sing
'Cos the man who can sing when he hasn't got a thing
He's the king of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide world
Of the whole wide world
When you meet by chance, it's not just by chance
It's kismet
When two hearts stand still, it's destiny's will
It's kismet


The wheel of fortune spins, round and around it goes
Who will the arrow point to, only kismet knows
Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met


This is my lucky day, love's in the cards, I'd say
Thanks to kismet, kismet, kismet


Until you came by, kismet and I were strangers
But now that you're here, it's suddenly clear we've met
This is my lucky day, love's in the cards, I'd say

Come on and be my love!


But how can you know for sure 


Oh, Norma Jean!


Is there really just one 

Come on, be my love!


So many songs, but I'm feeling so lonely...


You don't have to be beautiful


Oh!


To turn me on


Oh baby 
Wanna turn you on 


I just need your body, baby, from dusk 'til dawn


All night long


You don't need experience to turn me out

Well, I've got a gal, she's as cute as she can be
She's a distant cousin, but she's not too distant with me


We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins, and that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right


Oh, I've got a girl, and she taught me how to live
She can give a lot and she's got a lot to give


We'll kiss all night
I'll squeeze her tight
But we're kissin' cousins, and that's what makes it all right
All right, all right, all right



Yes we're all cousins, that's what I believe
Because we're children of Adam and Eve
I got a girl, and she wants a lot of love
That's the kind of trouble I need plenty of

Cousins, kissing cousins
Kissing's allowed because we're proud to be cousins
What's a little teasing, hugging and a-squeezin'
Between us cousins 

Oh, it's so great to be one big family
And we show it, yes we show it
You see, we never feud, we're a happy brood
Folks all know it, yes they know it

Cousins, kissing cousins
Honey, we wrest', and we mess
We're just cousins
Cousins, kissing cousins
Cousins, kissing cousins
Kiss me quick, while we still have this feeling
Hold me close and never let me go
'Cause tomorrows can be so uncertain
Love can fly and leave just hurtin'
Kiss me quick because I love you so 


Kiss me quick and make my heart go crazy
Sigh that sigh and whisper oh so low
Tell me that tonight will last forever
Say that you will leave me never
Kiss me quick because I love you so 


Let the band keep playing
While we are swaying
Let's keep on praying
That we'll never stop


Kiss me quick, I just can't stand this waiting
'Cause your lips are lips I want to know
For that kiss will open heaven's door
And we'll stay there forevermore
So, kiss me quick because I love you so 

Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him
In this world of fear and doubt
On my knees I ask the question
Why a lonely, heavy cross I must bear
Then he tells me in my prayer
It's because I am trustworthy
He gives me strength far more than my share


Known only to him are the great hidden secrets
I'll fear not the darkness when my flame shall dim
I know not what the future holds
But I know who holds the future
It's a secret known only to Him

Whenever I dance with the girl I love
My head goes 'round and 'round
When she's close to me
I can't stay on the ground

Whenever I dance with the girl I love
I never have a care
All night I'm so light
I walk right on the air


Oh let me, oh honey let me
Let me do what you know I love to do
Please take another chance and let me
Let me have another dance with you


Whenever I feel those pretty arms
Reaching 'round about
That feeling goes to my toes
And all the lights go out, go out, go out

Whenever I see those eyes of blue
Smiling up so shy
I'm in such a spin
I take right off and fly

Wherever you go
Wherever you may wonder in your life
Well surely you know, I always wanna be there
Holding your hand
And standing by to catch you when you fall
Seeing you through, in everything you do


I said let me be there in your morning
Let me be there in your night
Let me change whatever's wrong and make it right
Let me take you to that wonderland that only two can share
All I ask you, is let me be there


Watching you grow
And going through the changes in your life
That's how I know, I always wanna to be there
Whenever you feel you need a friend to lean on
Here I am
Whenever you call, you know I'll be there

Baby, let me be your loving teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be 
Your teddy bear


I don't wanna to be a tiger
Because tigers play too rough
I don't wanna be a lion
'Cause lions ain't the kind you love enough


Just wanna be your teddy bear
Put a chain around my neck
And lead me anywhere
Oh, let me be 
Your teddy bear


Baby, let me be around you every night
Run your fingers through my hair
And cuddle me real tight
Oh, let me be 
Your teddy bear
Don't be afraid, you and I were made the same, little one
And I know what it's like when you feel left out of the game, little one
But if you take this helping hand that I lend
Then we can smile together, let's be friends

The world that you see may seem to be a mystery to you
The night may be dark but hope very hard and dreams can come true
You live in silence, but for once let's pretend
We're talking here together, let's be friends

You're not alone, I've always known that we'd get along
And someone I know says life is good and He can't be wrong
There's fun and laughter just waiting 'round the bend
Let's find them now together, let's be friends
Let's find them now together, let's be friendsIf you let the stars keep telling you
Who to love and not to love
You may never find contentment for your heart
You could go unloved forever and darling that means never
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
You say that stars have promised you true love ten thousand times
But here you are with a broken heart and mind
I can tell you want to love me from the beating in your heart
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars, come follow me my dove
To a world just like the world that you've been dreaming of
Let's not wait too long for something might go wrong
Surrender to love, let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
Let's forget about the stars
Some people like to rock
Some people like to roll
But movin' and a-groovin' going to satisfy my soul

And we'll be blessed beneath the sign

So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice 
And let us sing together, sing together

With faith in him we'll never leave 
So let us pray together, pray together
Pray with the one mighty voice 
And let us sing together, sing together
Pray and we'll rejoice


The love of God is on our side

And we must give our brothers love

So let us pray together, pray together

Somewhere out in empty space
Long before the human race
Something stirred
A vast and timeless source began
Intelligence was born and then
There was the Word
Powers filled the universe
Matter formed and broke the curse
Of nothingness
Love became an ageless soul
Nature reached her highest goal
And breathed the breath of life
Everlasting life
Well, creatures come from out of sight
Daylight came from in the night
And all was good
Life became a master plan
Love produced a perfect man
That understood
The image of the Maker's word
Worshiped him with all he had
But then one day
From in the depths an evil seed
Grew and manufactured greed
That changed the way of life
Everlasting life

Oh, the loving power looked and saw
Inside the heart of man a flaw
Began to grow
Well, the fires of Hell began to burn
And so He sent his chosen son
To let us know
That love had surely made us all
And hate would surely make us fall
So from the cross
Well He showed the world that dreadful day
That love could be the only way
Or all is lost of life
Everlasting life
For life is love
And love is life
You gave me love to enjoy
Like a bright shiny toy to a baby
No matter what you would do
I depended on you like a baby
One thing I know I love you
Yes, I loved you like a baby

It was a fool's heart you took
And I fell 'cause you look like a baby
To lovers' ways, I was blind
'Cause I just had a mind like a baby
You're just a flirt
And I had to be hurt just like a baby



I need you so, I need you so

The day I found how you lied
Then I broke down and cried like a baby
Well, it was then I could see
You were playing with me like a baby
Well, you can bet that someday
I'll forget just like a baby
Tonight I'm alone without you, my dear
It seems that there's a longing for you still
Oh, but I just keep it there so I won't be alone
In our little cabin on the hill


Oh, someone has taken you from me
And left me here all alone
To listen to the rain beat on our window pane
In our little cabin on the hill
Little darling, little darling
Oh where, are you, oo oo oo oo
Walla walla chipa mocka mogga
Oh my lover, oh just for you, only you


My darling, I need you
Darling I need you to call my own
To hold your life, your little foot, your hand
I knew someone would understand that
Hold my hand

My dear, I would run
To find without you
Oo oo oo oo oo
Oh, oo oo oo
That my love was just for you, 'n only you
I went and bought myself a ticket
And I sat down in the very first row
They pulled the curtain
But then when they turned the spotlight way down low
Little Egypt came out a-struttin'
Wearing nothin' but a button and a bow


Singing, ying-ying, ying-ying
Ying-ying, ying-ying


She had a ruby on her tummy
And a diamond big as Texas on her toe
She let her hair down
And she did the hoochie-coochie real slow
When she did her special number on the zebra skin
I thought she'd stop the show




She did her triple somersault and when she hit the ground
She winked at the audience and then she turned around
She had a picture of a cowboy tattooed on her spine
Said, Phoenix, Arizona 1949

Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done


Well, I dated your big sister
And I took her to a show
I went for some candy
Along came Jim Dandy
And they snuck right out the door


Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you
Little sister, don't you kiss me once or twice
Then say it's very nice
And then you run
Little sister, don't you do what your big sister done


Every time I see your sister
Well, she's got somebody new
She's mean and she's evil
Like that little ol' boll weevil
Guess I'll try my luck with you
:
Ok me and Dook got a bone to pick
:

:

Get back to where you once belonged, yeah
It's a lonely man 
Who wanders all around 
It's a lonely man 
Who roams from town to town

Searching, always searching
For something he can't find
Hoping, always hoping
That someday fate will be kind

It's a lonely man 
Who travels all alone 
When he has no one 
That he can call his own

Always so unhappy
Taking shelter where he can
Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man 

Always so unhappy
Taking shelter where he can
Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man 


Here I am
Come meet a lonely, lonely man 
I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
I ain't even got a nickel
To call my baby on the phone


Just beyond the mountain lies a city
And I hear it calling me
Saddle up and ride, you lonesome cowboy
Here is where you'll find your destiny 
In my dreams the lights shine bright and pretty
Near to me and yet so far
Will I always be a lonesome cowboy
Am I only reaching for a star 



Ride, ride, ride
 Cowboy, cowboy
 Sing, sing, sing
 Cowboy, cowboy


Will I ever leave this lonesome valley
Really see the lights that shine 
Got to find what lies beyond the mountain
Got to rope and tie that dream of mine



I am just a lonesome cowboy
And I'm travelling all alone
If you don't call me, baby
Then I'm never coming home
Then I ain't ever coming home
There's a long line of mourners
Driving down our little street
Their fancy cars
Are such a sight to see, oh, yeah
They're all of your rich friends
Who knew you in the city
And now they've finally brought you
Brought you home to me


When you left, you know you told me
That some day you'd be returning
In a fancy car
All the town to see, oh, yeah
Well, now everyone is watching you
You finally had your dream
Yeah, and you're riding

In a long black limousine

You know the papers told of how you lost your life, oh, yeah
The party, the party and the fatal crash that night
Well, the race upon the highway, oh, the curve you didn't see
Well, you're riding in that long black limousine



Through tear filled eyes I watch
As you ride by, oh, yeah
A chauffeur
A chauffeur at the wheel dressed up so fine
Well, I'll never, I'll never love another
Oh, my heart, all my dreams
Yeah, they're with you
In that long black limousine


Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
Yeah, yeah, they're with you in that long black limousine
All right
I've been thumbing rides travelling light
Walking the streets till past midnight
Tramping roads, trails and lanes
Scaling cliffs fields and plains
Searching till the early dawn
For that long legged girl with the short dress on
Riding trucks, bikes and skis
Sailing lakes and brooks and seas
Driving wagons, cars and jeeps
Walking stilts in ten foot leaps
Searching till the early dawn

For that long legged girl with the short dress on
And everywhere I go she's been and gone
She's fine, it's just too bad she's the travelling kind
So fine, I just can't rest till I make her mine
I've been from Maine to Tennessee, Mexico and Waikiki
Rain or shine, sleet or snow
Searching high, searching low
Everything depends upon

We never got discouraged, we never had a doubt
'Cos sooner or later talent must win out
Look out Broadway, we're coming fast
Now we're gonna see our names in lights at last
No more hot dogs at Sloppy Joe's
We're gonna dine on steak and wine at Delmonico's
Rich or poor it's great to have dough
That's one thing we know
Lots of fun, lots of laughs

Signing cheques and contracts and autographs
We're up for N-E-W Y-O-R-K
Look out, look out Broadway
I wanna see all the hustle and bustle
Maybe I can get a date with Lillian Russell
I want to go out with Diamond Jim
Yeah, if he gives you a diamond what will you give to him
Blow the trumpets and beat on the drum
Big time here we come


No more cheap hotels and one night stands
We'll knock Tin Pan Alley flat on its pans
They'll see that we've got class with a capital K
Look out, look out Broadway
Look out!I remember how your eyes used to light up
Over promises that I made
But for the first time in my life
I know now how it feels to be afraid

I don't know what I'd do if you go away
This would sure be one lonely old town
For a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
I remember all the times you told me
Love's all that matters to you
And looking back now, wondering how I believed
I had things more important to do

I can see how I must have looked to you
Like some fool on a merry-go-round
And that a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love going down
Love going down

Can't you see how everything I've learned
Would just be wasted if you leave me
If you just give one more try
I swear I'll always be here when you need me

If you can find it in your heart to forgive me
I'll try to keep both my feet on the ground
But if a man's so busy going up in the world
That he couldn't see love coming down
Love coming down
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart

And I kiss the name that you sign

I am not a wise man neither am I a fool
But what I am, the way the good Lord made me
Though I need you more than you may ever understand
I can't wear a face that will betray me


Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
If you're gonna take me, take me for what I am
I can't be another man, I can't be free
'Cos the life I lead is the life I lead


Money in my pocket never seems to last too long
I've gambled on the way and drowned my sorrows
Though God knows, I can't pretend it's better on my own
I can't promise you a new tomorrow


Oh, if you're gonna love me, love the life I lead
Need the things I need, don't try to change me
