
I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone


So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground


I have loved you since we were eighteen 
Long before we both thought the same thing 
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holdin' you, oh
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen


We took a chance, God knows we've tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink, oh, love
And let's split the night wide open
And we'll see everything we can
Living love in slow motion, motion, motion

I got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me, I will use them both
We made a start, be it a false one I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone


So kiss me where I lay down
My hands pressed to your cheeks
A long way from the playground


I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were eighteen


When we were eighteen


I have loved you since we were eighteen
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved and to be in love
One, two, three, four


When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause I move a little slow when I dance
I can count on you after all that we've been through
'Cause I know that you'll always understand


I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
Hey!

When I'm fat and old and my kids think I'm a joke
'Cause the stories that I told, I tell again and again
I can count on you after all we got up to
'Cause I know that you truly understand


I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age 
No, I'll still feel the same, you will, too
Hey!


When I can hardly walk and my hair is fallin' out
We'll still stay up till mornin', we'll throw the after-party
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah


I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age 
No, I'll still feel the same around you
I won't act my age, no, I won't act my age 
No, I'll still feel the same, you will, too
Hey!
My mother told me I should go and get some therapy
I asked the doctor, "Can you find out what is wrong with me "
I don't know why I wanna be with every girl I meet
I can't control it, yeah, I know it's takin' over me


I'm going crazy, can't contain it
So tell me just what I should do


She said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"
She said, "Hey, it's alright, if it makes you feel alive"

Went to a party, just after the doctor talked to me
I met a girl, I took her hand up to the balcony
I whispered somethin' in her ear that I just can't repeat
She said, "Okay," but she was worried what her friends would think


She's going crazy, can't contain it
She asked me, "What should I do " Oh


I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"
I said, "Hey, it's alright, if it makes you feel alive"


We gotta live before we get older
Do what we like, we got nothing to lose
Shake off the weight of the world from your shoulders
Woah, we've got nothing to prove


I said, "Hey, it's alright, does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back, live your life, even if it's only for tonight"


I said, "Hey , it's alright, does it make you feel alive 
Don't look back , live your life, even if it's only for tonight"
I said, "Hey , it's alright, if it makes you feel alive"
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
There's nothing you can sing that can't be sung
There's nothing you can say, but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
Oh, there's nothing you can make that can't be made
There's no one you can save that can't be saved
There's nothing you can do, but you can learn how to be you in time
It's easy, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need

 & Harry]

There's nothing you can know that isn't known 

There's nothing you can see that isn't shown 
There's nowhere you can be that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


All you need is love, all you need is love
All you need is love, love, love is all you need

I ve been waiting, every day since
The last time we met, I can t forget what we parted ways with
I see your face and
Can t stop looking
I swear that these words haven t been heard
In the way I mean them


Is this really happening 
This is really happening
Can this keep on happening 

Together we re alone, both of us agreeing
No one needs to know, that you re already home
You don t have to go, but you re already leaving
Can we start believing  You re alr ady hom 
You don t have to go, 'cause you r  already hom 


We can t sleep in, for good reason
A bottle of wine, pretending it s fine
You breathe out I breathe in
We ve been stealing, moments, feelings
We know it s not right, your car is outside with a cold seat and


Is this really happening 
This is really happening
Can this keep on happening 


Together we re alone, both of us agreeing
No one needs to know, that you re already home
You don t have to go, but you re already leaving
Can we start believing  You re alr ady home
You don t have to go, 'cause you r  already home
Oooh
You don t have to go, 'cause you r  already home

Won't you stay 'til the A.M. 
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
Yeah, yeah


Feels like this could be forever tonight
Break these clocks, forget about time
There could be a World War 3 going on outside
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time 

Won't you stay 'til the A.M. 
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah


Feels like this could be forever right now
Don't wanna sleep 'cause we're dreamin' out loud
Tryin' to behave but you know that we never learn how
You and me were raised in the same part of town
Got these scars on the same ground
Remember how we used to kick around just wasting time 


Won't you stay 'til the A.M. 
All my favourite conversations
Always made in the A.M
'Cause we don't know what we're saying
We're just swimming 'round in our glasses
And talking out of our asses
Like we're all gonna make it, yeah, yeah

It's not me, it's not you, there's a reason
I'm just tryna read the signals I'm receivin'
Just like a stone on fire, can you feel it 
I don't know about you, girl, but I believe it


Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life


I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
I'll build you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world
Everyday, in every way, oh-oh-oh
I'll lift you up, I'll never stop
You know I'll take you to another world


One for me, one for you, whatcha doin' 
Girl, the music sounds so good when you're movin'
Let me take you higher, let me prove it
'Cause, hey, hey, pretty girl, I believe it


Words will be just words
Till you bring them to life

Whenever I close my eyes, I picture you there
I'm lookin' out at the crowd, you're everywhere
I'm watching you from the stage, yeah
Your smile is on every face now
But every time you wake up, you're hearing me say goodbye


Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you


I've never been so into somebody before
And every time we both touch, I only want more
So tell me nothing's gonna change, yeah
And you won't ever walk away, yeah
'Cause even though every night you'll know what I'll say, goodbye


Baby, you don't have to worry
I'll be coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you
Lately, I've been going crazy
So I'm coming back for you
Back for you, back for you, you

Maybe it's the way she walked 
Straight into my heart and stole it
Through the doors and past the guards
Just like she already owned it


I said "Can you give it back to me "
She said "Never in your wildest dreams."

Better than words, more than a feeling 
Crazy in love, dancing on the ceiling 
Every time we touch I'm all shook up
You make me wanna  How deep is your love 
God only knows, baby


 I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
 There's no way I can explain your love, no
 I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
 I can't explain your love, no
It's better than words

Better than words
Better than words, you drive me crazy
Someone like you, always be my baby
Best I ever had, hips don't lie
You make me wanna  one more night
Irreplaceable
Crazy, we're crazy


 I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
 There's no way I can explain your love, no

 I don't know how else to sum it up
'Cause words ain't good enough
 I can't explain your love, no


Everyone tries 
To see what it feels like 
But they'll never be right
'Cause it's better, it's better, it's better

The end of the night, we should say goodbye
But we carry on while everyone's gone


Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more 
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure


But, baby, if you say you want me to stay, I'll change my mind
'Cause I don't wanna know I'm walkin' away if you'll be mine
Won't go, won't go
So, baby, if you say you want me to stay, stay for the night
I'll change my mind


Lean in when you laugh, we take photographs
There's no music on, but we dance along


Never felt like this before
Are we friends or are we more 
As I'm walking towards the door
I'm not sure

Don't go
Don't go


Watchin' you get dressed messes with my head
Take that bag off your shoulder
Come, get back in bed, we've still got time left
This don't have to be over


And you say, "It's hard to keep a secret"
Girl, don't leave me all alone in this hotel
And these shades can hide us from the streets, yeah
One weekend, I'll promise that I'll never tell


You should probably stay, probably stay a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home, oh-oh
You should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home
Don't go, it's not the same when you're gone
And it's not good to be all alone
So, you should probably stay, be with me a couple more days
Come on, let me change your ticket home

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything
Or anyone


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world 


Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads

]
If I lay here
If I just lay here 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world  
Forget what we were told
Before we get too old 
Show me a garden that's bursting into life 

Oh-oh-oh-oh 
Oh-oh-oh-oh 


I know you say that you don't like it complicated
That we should try to keep it simple
But love is never, ever simple, no
Someday, you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me

Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end 
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end 
If we're never comin' back down
Yeah, we're lookin' down on the clouds


Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh


I know you said that you don't like it complicated
That you are tired of all the changes
Well, love is always, always changing, woah
But someday, you're gonna see the things that I see
You're gonna want the air that I breathe
You're gonna wish you never left me


Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end 
Here we go again
Another go-round for all of my friends
Another non-stop, will it ever end 
If we're never comin' back down
Yeah, we're lookin' down on the clouds

C'mon, c'mon 


The one that I came with
She had to go
But you look amazing
Standing alone


So, c'mon, c'mon
Move a little closer now
C'mon, c'mon
Ain't no way you're walking out
C'mon, c'mon
Show me what you're all about


Yeah, I've been watching you all night
There's something in your eyes
Saying, "C'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby"
Yeah, the music is so loud, I wanna be yours now
So, c'mon, c'mon, and dance with me, baby


The one that I came with
Didn't know how to move 
The way that you let your hair down
I can tell that you do

Diana


The front pages are your pictures, they make you look so small
How could someone not miss you at all  
I never would mistreat ya, no, I'm not a criminal
I speak a different language, but I still hear your call
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine

Diana


It's only been four months, but you've fallen down so far
How could someone mislead you at all  
I wanna reach out for ya, I wanna break these walls
I speak a different language, but I still hear you call
Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine


We all need somethin'
This can't be over now
If I could hold ya
Swear I'd never put you down


Diana, let me be the one to
Light a fire inside those eyes
You've been lonely, you don't even know me
But I can feel you crying
Diana, let me be the one to
Lift your heart up and save your life
I don't think you even realize
Baby, you'd be saving mine

He knows about you in every way
He's memorised every part of your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
Yeah, he knows everything there is to know


Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
Your favourite band, the way that you dance
But, baby, baby


Does he know you can move it like that  Woah
Does he know you're out and I want you so bad  Oh
Tonight, you're mine, baby
Does he know that you'll never go back  Oh
Does he know 


I catch your eye, then you turn away
But there's no hiding the smile on your face
Inside and out, baby, head to toe
He's not around, and girl, you let me know


Your secret tattoo, the way you change moods
The songs that you sing when you're all alone
He knows how you dance in front of your friends
But, baby, baby

Been a lot of places, I've been all around the world
Seen a lot of faces, never knowing where I was
On the horizon, hmm, but I know, I know, I know, I know
The sun will be rising back home
Living out of cases, and packing up and taking off
Made a lot of changes, but not forgetting who I was
On the horizon, ooh, well, I know, I know, I know, I know
The moon will be rising back home


Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song

I've been away for ages, but I got everything I need
I'm flicking through the pages I've written in my memory
I feel like I'm dreaming, oh, so I know, I know, I know, I know
That I'm never leaving, no, I won't go


Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong, home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
And the proof is in this song


Lights off when they should be on
Even stars in the skies, they're wrong
Short days, when the nights are long
When I think of the things I've done
Don't matter how far I've gone
I'm always free to run home


Don't forget where you belong, home
Don't forget where you belong , home
If you ever feel alone, don't
You were never on your own
Never, never, never, home

It s Christmastime and there s no need to be afraid
At Christmastime, we let in light, and we banish shade
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime


But say a prayer, and pray for the other ones
At Christmastime, it s hard but while you re having fun
There s a world outside your window, and it s a world of dread and fear
Where a kiss of love can kill you and there s death in every tear
And the Christmas bells that ring there are the clanging chimes of doom
Well tonight we re reaching out and touching you

Bring peace and joy this Christmas to West Africa
A song of hope where there's no hope tonight
Where to comfort is to fear
Why is touch is to be scared
How can they know it s Christmastime at all


Here s to you
Raise a glass to everyone
And here s to them
And all their years to come
How can they know it s Christmastime at all


Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Feed the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Heal the world, let them know it's Christmastime again
Heal the world
I've got fire for a heart, I'm not scared of the dark
You've never seen it look so easy
I got a river for a soul, and, baby, you're a boat
Baby, you're my only reason


If I didn't have you, there would be nothing left
The shell of a man who could never be his best
If I didn't have you, I'd never see the sun
You taught me how to be someone, yeah


All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
Nobody, nobody
 Nobody can drag me down 
Nobody, nobody
 Nobody can drag me down

Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey


Ever since you came around
Everybody wanna drag us down
Is it 'cause we look too happy 
I'll never forget when you looked at me
And told me it was all mine
I remember that like yesterday
It was a summer night on the west side
That was last summer, we had the best times, yeah
We crossed paths like an intersection
Now we both headed in one direction


All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down
All my life, you stood by me
When no one else was ever behind me
All these lights, they can't blind me
With your love, nobody can drag me down


 Nobody can drag me down 
Nobody can drag me 

Ain't nothing to break a chain or two
Nothing to nothing to break chain W
Hear the spit about a penthouse view
Yo changing, looking out from my red house view yo
That's all is done when the boys come through yo
Changing, looking out from my red house view 
Don't think about, be it
What nobody can do
D to the R to the A to the G me down, ain't nothing to be around
Harry and, James,  Niall, Liam, and Louis
Woah, hey, woah, hey, woah, hey, woah, hey, woah, hey, woah, hey, woah, woah, woah, woah
I told her that I loved her, was not sure if she heard
The roof was pretty windy and she didn't say a word
Party dying downstairs, had nothing left to do
Just me, her and the moon


I said, "You're on fire, babe"
Then down came the lightning on me
Love can be frightening for sure


All I know at the end of the day
Is you want what you want and you say what you say
And you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes
All I know at the end of the day
Is you love who you love, there ain't no other way
If there's something I've learned from a million mistakes
You're the one that I want at the end of the day


Oh, oh, oh 
Oh, na, na-na, na-na-na-na



She said the night was over, I said it's forever
Twenty minutes later, wound up in the hospital
The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu
But, girl, it's only you

You know I've always got your back, girl
So let me be the one you come running to, running to, ru , ru , runnin'
I see it's just a matter of fact, girl, you just call my name
I'll be coming through, coming through, I'll keep comin'
On the other side of the world, it don't matter
I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two, I'll be there in two
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to


It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me
It's everything about you, you, you 
The way you make it feel new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

It's everything about you, you, you 
It's everything about you, you, you 
It's everything that you do, do, do 
It's everything about you


Yes, I like the way you smile with your eyes
Other guys see it, but don't realise that it's my-my lovin'
There's something about your laugh that it makes me want to have to
There's nothing funny so we laugh at no-no-nothing
Every minute's like the last, so let's just take it real slow
Forget about the clock that's tick-tick-tickin'
I still feel it every time, it's just something that you do
Now ask me why I want to


It's everything about you, you, you
Everything that you do, do, do
From the way that we touch, baby
To the way that you kiss on me 
It's everything about you, you, you 
The way you make it feel, new, new, new
Like every party is just us two
And there's nothing I could point to

I think I'm gonna lose my mind
Something deep inside me, I can't give up
I think I'm gonna lose my mind
I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I'm out of luck 
I'm feeling something deep inside
Hotter than a jet stream burning up
I got a feeling deep inside
It's taking, it's taking all I've got
Yeah, it's taking, it's taking all I've got

'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long, it's been so long, maybe you were fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do


I think I'm gonna win this time
Ridin' on the wind and I won't give up
I think I'm gonna win this time
I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck
Yeah, I roll and I roll 'til I change my luck 


'Cause nobody knows you, baby, the way I do
And nobody loves you, baby, the way I do
It's been so long , it's been so long, you must be fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you do


It's been so long, it's been so long , maybe you were fireproof
'Cause nobody saves me, baby, the way you doVerso 1: Harry & Niall]
Creo que voy a perder la cabeza
Hay algo dentro de mi, que no puedo dejar
Creo que voy a perder la cabeza
Tiro y tiro hasta que me quedo sin suerte
Yeah, tiro y tiro hasta que me quedo sin suerte
Siento algo muy dentro de mi
Mas caliente que el vapor del agua calentandose
Tengo un sentimiento dentro de mi
Esta cogiendo, esta cogiendo todo lo que tengo
Yeah, esta cogiendo, esta cogiendo todo lo que tengo

Porque nadie te conoce, bebe, de la manera en la que yo lo hago
Y nadie te quiere, bebe, como yo lo hago
Ha pasado mucho tiempo, ha pasado mucho tiempo, a lo mejor somos a prueba de fuego
Porque nadie me salva, bebe, como tu lo haces


Creo que voy a ganar esta vez
Montando el viento y no me voy a rendir
Creo que voy a ganar esta vez
Tiro y tiro hasta que mi suerte cambie
Yeah, tiro y tiro hasta que mi suerte cambie



Porque nadie te conoce, bebe, de la manera en la que yo lo hago
Y nadie te quiere, bebe, como yo lo hago
Ha pasado mucho tiempo, ha pasado mucho tiempo, a lo mejor somos a prueba de fuego
Porque nadie me salva, bebe, como tu lo haces
I'm like a crow on a wire
You're the shinin' distraction that makes me fly home
I'm like a boat on the water
You're the raise on the waves that calm my mind, oh, every time


But I know in my heart
You're not a constant star
And, yeah, I've let you use me from the day that we first met
But I'm not done yet
Falling for your fool's gold
And I knew that you turned it on for everyone you met
But I don't regret
Falling for your fool's gold


I'm the first to admit that I'm reckless
I get lost in your beauty and I can't see two feet in front of me


And I know in my heart
You're just a moving part

Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait, we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not 
Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Sitting in a sandpit, life is a short trip
The music's for the sad man


Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever, forever young 

Some are like water, some are like the heat
Some are a melody and some are the beat
But sooner or later they all will be gone
Why don't they stay young 
It's hard to get old without a cause
I don't want to perish like a fading horse
Youth is like diamonds in the sun
And diamonds are forever


Forever young
I wanna be forever young
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never 
Forever young
I wanna be forever young, forever
Do you really wanna live forever
Forever or never 


So many adventures couldn't happen today
So many songs we forgot to play
So many dreams are swinging out of the blue
We let them come true

I think I've had enough
I might get a little drunk
I say what's on my mind, mmm
I might do a little time
'Cause all of my kindness, mmm
Is taken for weakness


Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days 'til Friday
I'm just tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that's all I want


Woke up an optimist
Sun was shinin', I'm positive
Then I heard you was talkin' trash
Hold me back, I'm 'bout to crash


Yeah, 'bout four, five seconds from wildin'
And we got three more days  til Friday
I m tryna make it back home by Monday mornin'
I swear I wish somebody would tell me
Ooh, that s all I want

Hey, hey
Oh, no, no, no


Her light is as loud as, as many ambulances
As it takes to save a saviour, oh, woah, woah, woah
Now, she floats through the room on a big balloon
Some say she's such a fake, that her love is made up, no, no, no, no
Let's have another toast to the girl almighty
Let's pray we stay young, stay made of lightnin'

Am I the only, only believer 
There, there's something happening here
There's something happening here
The only, only believer
There, there's something happening here
I hope you feel what I'm feeling, too


I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees for ya
I'd get down, I'd get down, I'd get down on my knees
I'd get down on my knees for you

I may not always love you


But long as there are stars above you


You never need to doubt it


I'll make you so sure about it


God only knows what I'd be without you


If you should ever leave me


Though life would still go on believe me


The world could show nothing to me


So what good would living do me

God only knows what I'd be without you


La, la, la, la, la, la

Oh, girl

So your friend's been telling me
You've been sleepin' with my sweater
And that you can't stop missing me
Bet my friend's been telling you I'm not doin' much better
Because I'm missin' half of me


And bein' here without you is like I'm wakin' up to


Only half a blue sky, kinda there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best, with half an arrow in my chest
I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you

Forget all we said that night
No, it doesn't even matter
'Cause we both got split in two
If you could spare an hour or so
We'll go for lunch down by the river
We can really talk it through


And bein' here without you is like I'm wakin' up to


Only half a blue sky, well, kinda there, but not quite
I'm walking around with just one shoe
I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a man, at best, with half an arrow in my chest
'Cause I miss everything we do
I'm half a heart without you


I'm half a heart without you
I'm half a heart without you


Though I try to get you out of my head
The truth is, I got lost without you
And since then, I've been wakin' up to

If you were a good friend
You'd always be there when I needed
'Cause I'm on my knees and, babe, I'm bleeding
And it kills me that you're not around


So you're not my girlfriend
Don't pretend that makes us nothing
Tell me you don't miss this feelin'
I'm starting to see who you are


'Cause there's a time, there's a place
And I'm always gonna hear your name
There's a right, there's a wrong
And now I see that all along
I messed up, you'll be fine
I'm gonna sleep alone tonight
Never gonna be the same
'Cause you're half the world away


A story you'd heard
Now you rest everything on these three words
Now I walk to you 'til my feet hurt
So tell me that's not good enough

You don't understand, you don't understand 
What you do to me when you hold his hand 
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate 
Made it so we had to walk away 


'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now



I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who'll hold you when you sleep
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave, so c'mon
Baby, be with me so happily


 It's 4AM and I know that you're with him
 I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
 And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care

You don't understand, you don't understand
What you do to me when you hold his hand
We were meant to be, but a twist of fate
Made it so we had to walk away


'Cause we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now
Yeah, we're on fire
We are on fire, we're on fire now



I don't care what people say when we're together
You know I wanna be the one who'll hold you when you sleep 
I just want it to be you and I forever
I know you wanna leave, so c'mon
Baby, be with me so happily


It's 4AM and I know that you're with him 
I wonder if he knows that I touched your skin
And if he feels my traces in your hair
I'm sorry, love, but I don't really care

Baby, you got me sick, I don't know what I did
Need to take a break and figure it out, yeah
Got your voice in my head saying, "Let's just be friends"
Can't believe the words came outta your mouth, yeah


I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right


And I'm, like, 
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted, thought you would be the one
It's giving me a heart attack
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh

Yeah, baby, now that you're gone, I can't stand dumb love songs
Missing you is all I'm thinkin' about, yeah
Everyone's telling me, I'm just too blind to see
How you messed me up, I'm better off now, yeah


I'm tryna be okay, I'm tryna be alright
But seeing you with him just don't feel right


And I'm, like, 
Never thought it'd hurt so bad, gettin' over you, ooh
And
You're giving me a heart attack looking like you do, ooh
'Cause you're all I ever wanted , thought you would be the one
It's giving me a heart attack
Gettin' over you, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh, oh
Yeah, every time you look like that 

*Oh-oh, oh* 
You're giving me a heart attack
I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can beat them, just for one day
We can be heroes, just for one day

And you, you can be mean
And I, I'll drink all the time

'Cause we're lovers, and that is a fact
Yes we're lovers, and that is that
Though nothing will keep us together
We could steal time just for one day
We can be heroes for ever and ever
What d'you say 
I, I wish you could swim
Like the dolphins, like dolphins can swim
Though nothing, nothing will keep us together
We can beat them, for ever and ever
Oh we can be Heroes, just for one day

I, I will be king
And you, you will be queen
Though nothing will drive them away
We can be Heroes, just for one day
We can be us, just for one day

I, I can remember 
Standing, by the wall 
And the guns, shot above our heads 
And we kissed, as though nothing could fall 
And the shame, was on the other side
Oh we can beat them, for ever and ever
Then we could be Heroes, just for one day

We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
We can be Heroes
Just for one day
We can be Heroes

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Hey angel, do you know the reasons why
We look up to the sky 
Hey angel, do you look at us and laugh
When we hold on to the past 
Hey angel


Oh, I wish I could be more like you 
Do you wish you could be more like me  
Oh, I wish I could be more like you 
Do you wish you could be more like me  


Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh


Hey angel, tell me, do you ever try
To come to the other side 
Hey angel
Tell me, do you ever cry when we waste away our lives 

You gotta help me
I'm losing my mind
Keep getting the feelin'
You wanna leave this all behind


Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we 

No, they don't teach ya
This in school
Now my heart's breakin'
And I don't know what to do


Thought we were going strong
I thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we 
You and me got a whole lot of history 
We could be the greatest team
That the world has ever seen
You and me got a whole lot of history 
So don't let it go, we can make some more
We can live forever
All of the rumours
All of the fights
But we always find a way
To make it out alive
Thought we were going strong
Thought we were holdin' on
Aren't we 

Make a little conversation
So long I've been waiting
To let go of myself and feel alive
So many nights I thought it over
Told myself I kind of liked her
But there was something missing in her eyes
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark 
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough  
Baby, we could be enough

And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home


So hot that I couldn't take it
Wanna wake up and see your face
And remember how good it was being here last night
Still high with a little feeling
I see the smile as it starts to creep in
It was there, I saw it in your eyes
I was stumbling
Looking in the dark 
With an empty heart
But you say you feel the same
Could we ever be enough  
Baby, we could be enough
And it's alright
Calling out for somebody to hold tonight
When you're lost, I'll find a way and I'll be your light
You'll never feel like you're alone
I'll make this feel like home

If I could fly
I'd be coming right back home to you
I think I might
Give up everything, just ask me to


Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenceless

For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only


I've got scars
Even though they can't always be seen
And pain gets hard
But now you're here and I don't feel a thing


Pay attention, I hope that you listen
'Cause I let my guard down
Right now, I'm completely defenceless


For your eyes only, I show you my heart
For when you're lonely and forget who you are
I'm missing half of me when we're apart
Now you know me, for your eyes only
For your eyes only


I can feel your heart inside of mine 
I've been going out of my mind 
Know that I'm just wasting time 
Hope that you don't run from me

I gotta feeling
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I gotta feeling 
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good night
That tonight's gonna be a good, good night
I gotta feeling 
Oh yeah

My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note, oh oh oh oh
Make me your radio
Turn me up when you feel low
This melody was meant for you
Just sing along to my stereo
Oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh
Sing along to my stereo
My heart's a stereo
It beats for you, so listen close
Hear my thoughts in every note




Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water 
And I, think of all the things
What you're doing
And through my head I make a picture 

'Cause since I've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
And I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress
Won't you come on over
Stop making a fool out of me
Why won't you come on over
Valerie, Valerie, Valerie, Valerie
Won't you come on over, Valerie 

Tell me you believe in love
It's not an illusion
Yeah


I've been thinking 'bout the nights and the dangerous tricks
People play on the eyes of the innocent 
I could turn a lot of hearts into breaks with smoke
And mirrors disappearing right in front of them 


But believe me 
I'm not trying to deceive ya 
I promise falling for me won't be a mistake


No, baby, this is not an illusion
I've really got my heart out on my sleeve 
Oh, baby, this is not an illusion
There's magic between you and me
No, baby, this is not an illusion
You really got me lifted off my feet
So, tell me you believe in love
'Cause it's not an illusion to me

Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen but the world still turns
Stuck in motion and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out


And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you


How many nights does it take to count the stars 
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay 
Lie awake, only hoping they're okay
I never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity

Down to Earth
Keep on falling when I know it hurts
Going faster than a million miles an hour
Tryna catch my breath some way, somehow
Down to Earth
It's like I'm frozen, but the world still turns
Stuck in motion, and the wheels keep spinning 'round
Moving in reverse with no way out


And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you

How many nights does it take to count the stars 
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth
How many nights have you wished someone would stay 
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Oh, infinity, oh, infinity
Infinity


Eyes can't shine
Unless there's something burning bright behind
Since you went away, there's nothing left in mine
I feel myself running out of time


And now I'm one step closer to being
Two steps far from you
When everybody wants you
Everybody wants you


How many nights does it take to count the stars 
That's the time it would take to fix my heart
Oh, baby, I was there for you
All I ever wanted was the truth, yeah, yeah
How many nights have you wished someone would stay 
Lie awake only hoping they're okay
I've never counted all of mine
If I tried, I know it would feel like infinity
Infinity, infinity, yeah
Infinity 
Oh, infinity 
Yeah, infinity 

Don't try to make me stay or ask if I'm okay
I don't have the answer
Don't make me stay the night or ask if I'm alright
I don't have the answer


Heartache doesn't last forever
I'll say I'm fine
Midnight ain't no time for laughing
When you say goodbye

It makes your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible


I've tried to ask myself, should I see someone else 
I wish I knew the answer
But I know, if I go now, if I leave, then I'm on my own tonight
I'll never know the answer


Midnight doesn't last forever
Dark turns to light
Heartache flips my world around
I'm falling down, down, down, that's why


I find your lips so kissable
And your kiss unmissable
Your fingertips so touchable
And your eyes, irresistible


Irresistible 
Irresistible 
Irresistible 
Irresistible

I keep playin' it inside my head, all that you said to me
I lie awake, just to convince myself this wasn't just a dream
'Cause you were right here and I should've taken the chance
But I got so scared and I lost the moment again
It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about


Is your heart taken  Is there somebody else on your mind 
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time 
Is your heart breaking  How do you feel about me now 
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I shoulda kissed you

I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you


Every morning when I leave my house, I always look for you, yeah
I see you every time I close my eyes, what am I gonna do 
And all my friends say that I'm punchin' over my weight
But in your eyes, I saw how you were looking at me
It's all that I can think about, oh, you're all that I can think about


Is your heart taken  Is there somebody else on your mind 
I'm so sorry, I'm so confused, just tell me, am I out of time 
Is your heart breaking  How do you feel about me now 
I can't believe I let you walk away when, when I shoulda kissed you


I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you
I shoulda, I shoulda, oh, I shoulda kissed you


When you stood there, just a heartbeat away
When we were dancin' and you looked up at me
If I had known then that I'd be feeling this way
If I could replay, I would've never have let you go
No, woah, never have let you go
Am I out of time 

Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I look inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied
Different date every night
You just got to say the word
But you're not into them at all
You just want materials
I should know because I've heard the girls say

I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you


You've got everythin' you need
But you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you
I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say


I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
Oh, and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want, but that's crazy
I want, I want, I want, and that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you


Be loved by you, I wanna
I'll stay true, I wanna
If you knew what you put me through
Would you want, you want, you want me to love you too 

Give you this, give you that
Blow a kiss, take it back
If I looked inside your brain
I would find lots of things
Clothes, shoes, diamond rings
Stuff that's driving me insane
You could be preoccupied, different date every night
You just got to say the word
That you're not into them at all, you just want materials
I should know because I've heard when girls say


I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you


You've got everything you need, but you want accessories
Got to hold it in your hand
If I changed the world for you, I bet you wouldn't have a clue
Don't you know that I can't stand when girls say


I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you
Oh and all the girls say
I want, I want, I want
But that's crazy
I want, I want, I want
And that's not me
I want, I want, I want to be loved by you

I wanna write you a song
One as beautiful as you are sweet
With just a hint of pain
For the feeling that I get when you are gone
I wanna write you a song
I wanna lend you my coat
One that's as soft as your cheek
So when the world is cold
You will have a hiding place you can go
I wanna lend you my coat

Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do


I wanna build you a boat
One as strong as you are free
So any time you think
That your heart is gonna sink, you know it won't
I wanna build you a boat


Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, and giving back is all I wanna do, ooh
Ooh, everything I need I get from you
Ooh, giving back is all I wanna do, ooh


I wanna write you a song
One to make your heart remember me
So any time I'm gone
You can listen to my voice and sing along
I wanna write you a song
I wanna write you a song
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na


He takes your hand, I die a little
I watch your eyes and I'm in riddles
Why can't you look at me like that  
When you walk by, I try to say it
But then I freeze and never do it
My tongue gets tied, the words get trapped


I hear the beat of my heart getting louder
Whenever I'm near you


But I see you, with him, slow dancin'
Tearing me apart 'cause you don't see
Whenever you kiss him, I'm breakin'
Oh, how I wish that was me
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

Lately, I found myself thinking
Been dreaming about you a lot
And up in my head, I'm your boyfriend
But that's one thing you've already got
He drives to school every morning
While I walk alone in the rain
He'd kill me without any warning
If he took a look in my brain


Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby, you should know that I would, I would
Would he say he's in L-O-V-E 
Well, if it was me, then I would, I would
Would he hold you when you're feeling low 
Baby, you should know that I would


Back in my head, we were kissing
I thought things were going alright 
With a sign on my back saying "Kick me"
Reality ruined my life 
Feels like I'm constantly playing
A game that I'm destined to lose
'Cause I can't compete with your boyfriend
He's got twenty-seven tattoos

Oh, oh, oh


She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
I'm so whipped on her tiny little
She's a tempting animal
Spends too much and I never tell her no
Drives me nuts and she got me by the throat
She's so mean but I kinda love it
And I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go
La la la, la la la la la la la
I just can't let her go


Breaks a billion hearts
I know I'm next in line
But I don't mind, yeah, oh oh oh
I want her everybody wants her
She knows it, ay ay ay
I want her, but I better run away
Oh oh oh

Looking out a dirty old window
Down below the cars in the city go rushing by
I sit here alone and I wonder why
Friday night and everyone's moving
I can feel the heat but it's soothing, heading down
I search for the beat in this dirty town


Downtown, the young ones are going
Downtown, the young ones are growing

We're the kids in America, oh
We're the kids in America, oh
Everybody live for the music-go-round


Bright lights, the music gets faster
Look, girl, don't check on your watch, not another glance
I'm not leaving now, honey, not a chance
Hot-shot, give me no problems
Much later, baby, you'll be saying nevermind
You know life is cruel, life is never kind


Kind hearts don't make a new story
Kind hearts don't grab any glory


We're the kids in America, oh
We're the kids in America, oh
Everybody live for the music-go-round


La-la-la-la-la-la-la, sing!
La-la-la-la-la la, sing!
La-la-la-la-la-la-la, sing!
La-la-la-la-la la

Oh, I just wanna take you anywhere that you'd like
We could go out any day, any night
Baby, I'll take you there, take you there

We've been friends now for a while
Wanna know that when you smile
Is it me, yeah 
Are you thinking of me, yeah  Oh, oh


Girl, what would you do 
Would you wanna stay
If I were to say 

I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your, let me be your last first kiss
I wanna be first, yeah
Wanna be the first to take it all the way like this
And if you only knew

Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss


Baby, tell me what to change
I'm afraid you'll run away
If I tell you
What I've wanted to tell you, yeah
Maybe I just gotta wait
Maybe this is a mistake
I'm a fool, yeah
Baby, I'm just a fool, yeah, oh, oh

And if you only knew
I wanna be last, yeah
Baby, let me be your last
Your last first kiss

One
A part of me s breaking
You came in my head today
Won t go away, no
I thought I d remembered how to forget
Two
Hearts are divided
Now that we re worlds apart
They seem so hard to take
I thought I'd remembered but not just yet


Let's not make this complicated
We were never meant to make it
This time
It s not too late for us to save this


So, I didn t wanna have to go
But we need a little time alone
I can t bear when you g t scared
And you try not to let it show
I ll be so glad I found ya
Th n I ll put my arms around ya
When you lay down with me

Little black dress just walked into the room
Makin' heads turn, can't stop looking at you
It's so right, it's so right, it's so right, you know
Little black dress, did you come here alone 
It's too late, it's too late, it's too late to go home
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know


I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me 

Little black dress, who you doin' it for 
Little black dress, I can't take any more
It's not right, it's not right, it's not right, you know
Little black dress, what's your favorite song 
Little black dress, I won't do you no harm
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright, you know
It's alright, it's alright 'cause I'll take you home


I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me




I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me, baby
I wanna see the way you move for me
Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly


I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though it makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me


I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things


You'll never love yourself half as much as I love you
And you'll never treat yourself right, darling, but I want you to
If I let you know, I'm here for you
Maybe you'll love yourself like I love you, oh


And I've just let these little things slip out of my mouth
'Cause it's you, oh, it's you, it's you, they add up to
And I'm in love with you and all these little things

Your hand fits in mine like it's made just for me
But bear this in mind: It was meant to be
And I'm joinin' up the dots with the freckles on your cheeks
And it all makes sense to me
I know you've never loved the crinkles by your eyes when you smile
You've never loved your stomach or your thighs
The dimples in your back at the bottom of your spine
But I'll love them endlessly


I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if I do, it's you, oh, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things


You can't go to bed without a cup of tea
And maybe that's the reason that you talk in your sleep
And all those conversations are the secrets that I keep
Though It makes no sense to me
I know you've never loved the sound of your voice on tape
You never want to know how much you weight
You still have to squeeze into your jeans
But you're perfect to me


I won't let these little things slip out of my mouth
But if it's true, it's you, it's you, they add up to
I'm in love with you and all these little things

If this room was burnin'
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies


You say it's gettin' late, it's gettin' late
And you don't know if you can stay, if you can stay
But you, you don't tell the truth, no, you, you like playing games
Your hands touching me, they're touching me
And your eyes keep saying things
They're sayin' what we do when it's only me and you
I can't concentrate


That's all I'm thinkin' about, all I keep thinkin' about
Everythin' else just fades away


If this room was burnin'
I wouldn't even notice
'Cause you've been takin' up my mind
With your little white lies, little white lies
You say you're a good girl
But I know you would, girl
'Cause you've been telling me all night
With your little white lies, little white lies
With your little white lies, little white lies

Hey, girl, I'm waitin' on ya, I'm waitin' on ya
Come on and let me sneak you out
And have a celebration, a celebration
The music up, the windows down

We made a fire, went down in the flames
We sailed an ocean and drowned in the wave
Built a cathedral, but we never prayed
We had it all, yeah, and we walked away


Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you but I struggle 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down, it's a long way down from here

We had a mountain, but took it for granted
We had a spaceship, but we couldn't land it
We found an island, but we got stranded
We had it all, yeah, who could've planned it 


Point of no return and now it's just too late to turn around
I try to forgive you, but I'm struggling 'cause I don't know how
We built it up so high and now I'm falling
It's a long way down from here


Such a long way down from here
It's a long way down
It's a long way down
Such a long way down
It's a long way down
It's a long way downNone


...
... you ever know
Is it all inside of my head 
...
... no


We looking bad
And mess around
And I was there
 ...
...
Girl, that should be me driving to your house
Knockin' on your door and kissing you on the mouth
Holdin' on your hand, dancin' in the dark
'Cause I was the only one who loved you from the start


But now when I see you with him
It tears my world apart because


I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first

Girl, it should be me callin' on your phone
Saying you're the one and that I'll never let you go
I never understood what love was really like
But I felt it for the first time lookin' in your eyes


But now when I see you with him
My whole world falls apart because


I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first
Had my chances, coulda been where he is standin'
That's what hurts the most, girl, I came so close
But now you'll never know, baby, I loved you first


First touch, the first kiss
First girl who made me feel like this
Heartbreak, it's killing me
I loved you first, why can't you see 


I've been waitin' all this time to finally say it
But now I see your heart's been taken
And nothing could be worse, baby, I loved you first

It's inevitable, everything that's good comes to an end
It's impossible to know if after this we can still be friends, yeah
I know you're sayin' you don't wanna hurt me
Well, maybe you should show a little mercy
The way you look, I know you didn't come to apologise


Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life 
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time 
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye


Unforgettable together, held the whole world in our hands
Unexplainable, a love that only we could understand, yeah
I know there's nothing I can do to change it
But is there something that can be negotiated 
My heart's already breaking, baby, go on, twist the knife


Hey, hey, hey
Oh, why you wearing that to walk out of my life 
Hey, hey, hey
Oh, even though it's over, you should stay tonight
Hey, hey, hey
If tomorrow you won't be mine
Won't you give it to me one last time 
Oh, baby, let me love you goodbye

B-B-B-Baby, c'mon over
I don't care if people find out

They say that we're no good together
And it's never gonna work out



But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
 I can't hold back

'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic


So le-le-let them take the pictures
Spread it all around the world now

I wanna put it on my record
I want everyone to know now



But baby you got me moving too fast
'Cause I know you wanna be bad
And girl when you're looking like that
 I can't hold back


'Cause you, you've got this spell on me
I don't know what to believe
Kiss you once, now I can't leave
'Cause everything you do is magic
But everything you do is ma-a-agic

One, two, three, four


Straight off the plane to a new hotel
Just touched down, you could never tell
Ow, big house party with a crowded kitchen
People talk shh, but we don't listen


Tell me that I'm wrong, but I do what I please
Way too many people in the Addison Lee
Now I'm at the age when I know what I need, oh, woah


Midnight memories, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Baby, you and me stumblin' in the street
Singing, singing, singing, singing
Midnight memories, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anywhere we go, never say no
Just do it, do it, do it, do it


Five foot somethin' with the skinny jeans
Don't look back, baby, follow me
I don't know where I'm going, but I'm findin' my way
Same old shh, but a different day

Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heart beats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face


If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time


You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today


Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don't wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face

Shut the door, turn the light off
I wanna be with you, I wanna feel your love
I wanna lay beside you
I cannot hide this, even though I try
Heartbeats harder, time escapes me
Trembling hands touch skin
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face


If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time

You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I ll find the words to say before you leave me today


Close the door, throw the key
Don't wanna be reminded, don't wanna be seen
Don t wanna be without you
My judgement's clouded like tonight's sky
Hands are silent, voice is numb
Try to scream out, my lungs
It makes this harder
And the tears stream down my face


If we could only have this life for one more day
If we could only turn back time


You know I'll be your life, your voice
Your reason to be my love, my heart
Is breathing for this moment, in time
I'll find the words to say before you leave me today

Ooh


I'm broken, do you hear me 
I'm blinded, 'cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing alone, I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around


And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say

When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this


If I'm louder, would you see me 
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me 
'Cause we are the same, you save me
But when you leave, it's gone again


And then I see you on the street
In his arms, I get weak
My body fails, I'm on my knees, praying


When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this

Ooh


I'm broken, do you hear me 
I'm blinded 'cause you are everything I see
I'm dancing alone, I'm praying
That your heart will just turn around


And as I walk up to your door
My head turns to face the floor
'Cause I can't look you in the eyes and say


When he opens his arms and holds you close tonight
It just won't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this, yeah
When he lays you down, I might just die inside
It just don't feel right
'Cause I can love you more than this
Can love you more than this


If I'm louder, would you see me 
Would you lay down in my arms and rescue me 
'Cause we are the same, you save me
When you leave, it's gone again

Guess this means you're sorry
You're standing at my door
I guess this means you take back
All you said before
Like how much you wanted
Anyone but me
Said you'd never come back
But here you are again


'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life  would suck  without you


Maybe I was stupid for telling you goodbye
Maybe I was wrong for 


'Cause we belong together now, yeah
Forever united here somehow, yeah
You got a piece of me and honestly
My life  would suck  without you
We've got a bit of love-hate
You take me to the edge, then you hit the brakes
I, I say it's over one day
But then I'm crawling back, begging you to stay
We make up and we breakup all the time 
I'll say that I hate a song
Then you'll go request it the whole night long
S-some people say it's so wrong
But even when we fight, girl, you turn me on
We make up and we breakup all the time
We're like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
Always like, "Na-na-na"
Then we're like, "Yeah, yeah, yeah"
No, we can't make up our minds
'Cause when we think we've got it right
We go, "Na-na-na, na-na-na, na-na-na"



You wanna party till late
But when I do the same all you do is complain
Y-you know that it drives me insane
But when I get with you, girl, you make it okay
We make up and we break up all the time

Wanna pull an all-nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"


Lips so good I forget my name
I swear I could give you everything


I don't need my love, you can take it
You can take it and take it
I don't need my heart, you can break it
You can break it and break it
I just can't get too much of you, baby
It's never, it's never enough
Never enough
It's never enough
Never enough


Come on
Come on


Wanna pull an all-nighter and get into something we'll never forget
Wanna stay up and party the weekend away and not know when to quit
Wanna drive in the night to the end of the earth and go over the edge
Wanna wake up with you and say, "Baby, let's do it all over again"

Going out tonight changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Everything she never had she's showing off


Driving too fast
Moon is breaking through her hair
She said it was something that she won't forget
Having no regrets is all that she really wants

We're only getting older, baby
And I've been thinking about it lately
Does it ever drive you crazy
Just how fast the night changes 
Everything that you've ever dreamed of
Disappearing when you wake up
But there's nothing to be afraid of
Even when the night changes
It will never change me and you


Chasing it tonight
Doubts are running 'round her head
He's waiting, hides behind a cigarette
Heart is beating loud and she doesn't want it to stop


Moving too fast
Moon is lighting up her skin
She's falling, doesn't even know it yet
Having no regrets is all that she really wants


We're only getting older, baby

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


Goin' out tonight, changes into something red
Her mother doesn't like that kind of dress
Reminds her of the missing piece of innocence she lost

You're so pretty when you cry, when you cry
Wasn't ready to hear you say goodbye
Now you're tearing me apart, tearing me apart
You're tearing me apart
You're so London your own style, your own style
And together we're so good, so, girl, why
Are you tearing me apart, tearing me apart 
You're tearing me apart


Did I do something stupid  Yeah, girl, if I blew it
Just tell me what I did, let's work through it
There's gotta be some way
To get you to want me like before


'Cause no one ever looks so good in a dress
And it hurts 'cause I know you won't be mine tonight
No one ever makes me feel like you do when you smile
Baby, tell me how to make it right
Now, all of my friends say it's not really worth it
But even if that's true
No one in the world could stop me from not moving on
Baby, even if I wanted to
Nobody compares to you

Nobody knows
Nobody knows but me I sometimes cry
If I could pretend that I'm asleep
When my tears start to fall
I peek out from behind these walls
I think nobody knows
Nobody knows


And nobody likes 
Nobody likes to lose their inner voice 
The one I used to hear before my life
Made a choice


But I think nobody knows 
Nobody knows


Baby, oh, your secret's safe with me
There's nowhere else in the world that I could ever be
Baby, oh don't it feel like you're all alone 
Who's gonna be there when the last angel has flown 
And I've lost your way back home
I said nobody knows

Oh



Stained coffee cup
Just a fingerprint of lipstick's not enough
Sweet , where you lay
Still a trace of innocence on the pillow case
Waking up beside you, I'm a loaded gun
I can't contain this anymore
I'm all yours, I've got no control, no control
Powerless, and I don't care it's obvious
I just can't get enough of you
The pedal's down, my eyes are closed, no control
Oh



Taste on my tongue
I don't want to wash away the night before
In the heat , where you lay
I could stay right here and burn in it all day



Remember the day we were giving up
When you told me I didn't give you enough
And all of your friends were saying I'd be leaving ya 
She's lyin' in bed with my t-shirt on
Just thinking how I went about it wrong
This isn't the stain of a red wine, I'm bleeding love


Please, believe me, don't you see the things you mean to me 
Oh, I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia 
I've been idolizing the light in your eyes, Olivia 
I live for you, I long for you, Olivia
Don't let me go, don't let me go


Say what you're feelin' and say it now
'Cause I got the feelin' you're walkin' out
And time is irrelevant when I've not been seeing ya
The consequences of falling out
That's something I'm having nightmares about
And these are the reasons I'm cryin' out to be with ya

Once in a lifetime, it's just right
We make no mistakes
Not even a landslide or riptide
Could take it all away


Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
It sounds like you

When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side


Once in a lifetime, it's just right
And we are always safe
Not even the bad guys in the dark night
Could take it all away
Somehow, it feels like nothing has changed
Right now, my heart is beating the same
Out loud, someone's calling my name
And it sounds like you
When I close my eyes
All the stars align
And you are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side
You are by my side

It's gotta be you
Something's gotta give now
Everyone else in the room can see it
Only you
I need you here with me now
Everyone else but you


And if you 
You want me to 
We'll be doing what we'll do
Let's make a move
And if you 
You want me to 
Just pretending that we're cool
And we know it too

And I'll be gone, gone tonight
Singing, singing, singing
The best song ever
Been holding on so tight
With nothing in between
Nothing can come between


You and I
Na-na-na-na-na-na
We're only getting older, baby
Na-na-na-na-na-na
Does it ever drive you crazy 


If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Nobody, nobody
Nobody can drag me down
If you like to do whatever you've been dreaming about
We got a whole lot of history
So let's start right now


You're insecure
Tried playing it cool
Don't know what for
When I'm looking at you
Don't need make-up
Be brave, be brave
Cause the way that you are is enough

I've tried playin' it cool
But when I'm lookin' at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep makin' me weak
Yeah, frozen and can't breathe


Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to make you see
That I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing

So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing


Now I'm climbing the walls
But you don't notice at all
That I'm goin' out of my mind
All day and all night


Something's gotta give now
'Cause I'm dyin' just to know your name
And I need you here with me now
'Cause you've got that one thing


So get out, get out, get out of my head
And fall into my arms instead
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
So get out, get out, get out of my mind
And come on, come into my life
I don't, I don't, don't know what it is
But I need that one thing
And you've got that one thing

I've tried playing it cool
But when I'm looking at you
I can't ever be brave
'Cause you make my heart race
Shot me out of the sky
You're my kryptonite
You keep making me weak
Yeah, frozen, and can't breathe


Something's gotta give now

Said I'd never leave her, 'cause her hands fit like my T-shirt
Tongue tied over three words, cursed
Running over thoughts that make my feet hurt
Bodies intertwined with her lips
Now she's feeling so low since she went solo
Hole in the middle of my heart like a Polo
And it's no joke to me
So can we do it all over again 


If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again

Can we take the same road  Two days in the same clothes 
And I know just what she'll say if I can make all this pain go
Can we stop this for a minute 
You know, I can tell that your heart isn't in it or with it
And tell me with your mind, body and spirit
I can make your tears fall down like the showers that are British
Whether we're together or apart, we can both remove the masks
And admit we regret it from the start


If you're pretending from the start
Like this, with a tight grip
Then my kiss can mend your broken heart
I might miss everything you said to me
And I could lend you broken parts
That might fit like this
And I will give you all my heart
So we can start it all over again


You'll never know how to make it on your own
And you'll never show weakness for letting go
I guess it's still hard if the seed's sown
But do you really want to be alone 

I might never be your knight in shinin' armour
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight


When I first saw you from across the room
I could tell that you were curious, oh, yeah
Girl, I hope you're sure what you're looking for
'Cause I'm not good at making promises


But if you like causing trouble up in hotel rooms
And if you like having secret little rendezvous
If you like to do the things you know that we shouldn't do
Then, baby, I'm perfect
Baby, I'm perfect for you
And if you like midnight driving with the windows down
And if you like goin' places we can't even pronounce
If you like to do whatever you've been dreamin' about
Then, baby, you're perfect
Baby, you're perfect
So let's start right now


I might never be the hands you put your heart in
Or the arms that hold you any time you want them
But that don't mean that we can't live here in the moment
'Cause I can be the one you love from time to time

I might never be your knight in shining armor
I might never be the one you take home to mother
And I might never be the one who brings you flowers
But I can be the one, be the one tonight

So let's start right now

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh


There's a lightnin' in your eyes, I can't deny
Then there's me inside a sinking boat, runnin' out of time
Without you, I'll never make it out alive
But I know, yes, I know we'll be alright
There's a devil in your smile, it's chasing me
And every time I turn around, it's only gaining speed
There's a moment when you finally realise
There's no way you can change the rolling tide
But I know, yes, I know that I'll be fine


This time, I'm ready to run 
Escape from the city and follow the Sun
'Cause I wanna be yours, don't you wanna be mine 
I don't wanna get lost in the dark of the night
This time I'm ready to run 
Wherever you are is the place I belong
'Cause I wanna be free and I wanna be young
I will never look back, now I'm ready to run


Ooh-ooh-ooh
I'm ready to run
Ooh-ooh-ooh

Lights go down, and
The night is calling to me, yeah
I hear voices
Singing songs in the street, and I know


That we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
That I won't be on my own
Yeah, I love this feeling and


Right now I wish you were here with me 
'Cause right now, everything is new to me 
You know, I can't fight the feeling
And every night I feel it
Right now I wish you were here with me 


Late-night spaces
With all our friends, you and me, yeah
Love these faces
Just like how it used to be


And we won't be going home
For so long, for so long, but I know
I won't be on my own
On my own, I'm feeling like



Do you remember summer '09 
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, was the best time of my life
Lyin' on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh, my, my, they could never shut us down


I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go 
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe


I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah


Yeah, we were together, summer '09
Wanna roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye 

Do you remember summer '09 
Wanna go back there every night
Just can't lie, was the best time of my life
Lyin' on the beach as the sun blew out
Playing this guitar by the fire too loud
Oh, my, my, they could never shut us down


I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go 
Under the moonlight as we stared at the sea
The words you whispered, I will always believe

I want you to rock me, rock m , rock me, yeah
I want you to rock me, rock m , rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah


Yeah, we were together, summer '09
Wanna roll back like pressing rewind
You were mine and we never said goodbye 


I used to think that I was better alone
Why did I ever wanna let you go

I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah
I want you to hit the pedal, heavy metal, show me you care
I want you to rock me, rock me, rock me, yeah


Now ladies and gentlemen, scream

Circles, we're going in circles, dizzy's all it makes us
We know where it takes us, we've been before
Closer, maybe looking closer, there's more to discover
Find out what went wrong without blamin' each other


Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds

Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes


Wake up, we both need to wake up
Maybe if we face up to this, we can make it through this
Closer, maybe we'll be closer, stronger than we were before, yeah
Make this something more, yeah


Think that we got more time
When we're falling behind
Gotta make up our minds


Or else we'll play, play, play all the same old games
And we wait, wait, wait for the end to change
And we take, take, take it for granted that we'll be the same
But we're making all the same mistakes
Yeah, yeah, that's what crazy is
When it's broke and you say there's nothing to fix
And you pray, pray, pray that everything will be okay
While you're making all the same mistakes

I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh


It's a quarter to three, can't sleep at all
He's so overrated
If you told me to jump, I'd take the fall
And he wouldn't take it


All that you want's under your nose, yeah
You should open your eyes, but they stay closed, closed


I, I wanna save ya
Wanna save your heart tonight
He'll only break ya
Leave you torn apart, oh
I can't be no Superman
But for you, I'll be super human
I, I wanna save ya, save ya, save ya tonight


Oh, now you're at home and he don't call
'Cause he don't adore ya
To him, you are just another doll
And I tried to warn ya

Yeah! 
One, two, three, quick!


She sneaks out in the middle of the night, yeah
Tight dress with the top cut low 
She's addicted to the feeling, never letting go, oh-woah 
She walks in and the room just lights up
But she don't want anyone to know
That I'm the only one that gets to take her home, oh-woah 


But every time I tell her that I want more
She closes the door


She's not afraid of all the attention
She's not afraid of running wild
How come she's so afraid of falling in love 
She's not afraid of scary movies
She likes the way we kiss in the dark
But she's so afraid of fa-fa-falling in love, love


Maybe she's just tryna test me
Wanna see how hard I'm gonna work
Wanna see if I can really tell how much she's worth 
And maybe all her friends have told her
"Don't get closer, he'll just break your heart"
But either way she sees in me and it's just so hard 

I was her she was me
We were one we were free
And if there's somebody calling me on
She's the one
We were young we were wrong
We were fine all along
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one


When you get to where you want to go
And you know the things you want to know
You're smiling
When you said what you want to say
And you know the way you want to play, yeah
You'll be so high you'll be flying

Though the sea will be strong
I know we'll carry on
'Cause if there's somebody calling me on
She's the one

 & One Direction]
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one, yeah, she's the one
If there's somebody calling me on

She's the one, she's the one
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one, she's the one
If there's somebody calling me on
She's the one, she's the one]
There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun 

]
And I need to tell you
That you light up every second of the day 
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight, yeah
Girl, you take my breath away
The way you look tonight
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh


One day, you'll come into my world and say it all
You'll say we'll be together even when you're lost
One day, you'll say these words I've thought, but never said
You'll say we're better off together in our bed


I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imaginin' 
Come on, jump out at me 
Come on, bring everything 
Is it too much to ask for something great  


The script was written and I could not change a thing
I want to rip it all to shreds and start again
One day, I'll come into your world and get it right
I'll say we're better off together here tonight


I want you here with me
Like how I pictured it
So I don't have to keep imaginin' 
Come on, jump out at me 
Come on, bring everything 
Is it too much to ask for something great  

Who's gonna be the first one to start the fight 
Who's gonna be the first one to fall asleep at night 
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away 
Who's gonna be the last one to forget this place 


We keep taking turns 
Will we ever learn 


Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya, even though I tried
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye 
Bye


Who's gonna be the first one to compromise 
Who's gonna be the first one to set it all on fire 
Who's gonna be the last one to drive away 
Forgetting every single promise we ever made


Oh, spaces between us keep getting deeper
It's harder to reach ya, even though I tried
Spaces between us hold all our secrets
Leavin' us speechless and I don't know why
Who's gonna be the first to say goodbye 
Bye

From the moment I met you, everything changed
I knew I had to get you, whatever the pain
I had to take you and make you mine 
I would walk through the desert, I would walk down the aisle
I would swim all the oceans just to see you smile
Whatever it takes is fine 


Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin'
Every piece of your heart, every piece of your heart


I know your heart's been broken, but don't you give up
I'll be there, yeah, I know it, to fix you with love
It hurts me to think that you've ever cried 


Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
So put your hands up
Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
'Cause it's a stand up
And I won't be leavin' till I've finished stealin'

We want the same things, we dream the same dreams, alright, alright
I got it all 'cause she is the one
Her mum calls me "Love", her dad calls me "Son", alright, alright


I know, I know, I know for sure


Everybody wanna steal my girl
Everybody wanna take her heart away
Couple billion in the whole wide world
Find another one 'cause she belongs to me
Everybody wanna steal my girl

Na na na na na na na
Oh yeah

She belongs to me


Kisses like cream, her walk is so mean
And every jaw drops when she's in those jeans, alright, alright
I don't exist, if I don't have her
The sun doesn't shine, the world doesn't turn, alright, alright

Hello, hello, I know it's been a while, but, baby
I got something that I really wanna let you know, yeah
Something that I wanna let you know
You say, you say to everybody that you hate me
Couldn't blame you 'cause I know I left you all alone, yeah
I know that I left you all alone


Yeah, now I'm back at your door
You're lookin' at me unsure
I shoulda seen it before
You're all I think about, baby


I was so stupid for lettin' you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
You might have moved on, but, girl, you should know
That I-I-I know you're still the one
I know it's saying too much, but I will never give up
I was so stupid for lettin' you go
But I-I-I know you're still the one
I-I-I know you're still the one


Hello, hello, I'm really hoping you'll forgive me
I keep talking, begging, tell me what I wanna hear, yeah
Girl, just tell me what I wanna hear
I tried, I'll try to start again and find somebody
But I remember all the times and all the words we said, yeah
I can't get it out of my head, yeah

Who's that shadow holding me hostage  I've been here for days
Who's this whisper telling me that I'm never gonna get away 
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But I fear I'm getting used to
Being held by you


Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 

Who's this man that's holding your hand and talking 'bout your eyes  
Used to sing about being free but now he's changed his mind 
I know they'll be coming to find me soon
But my Stockholm syndrome is in your room
Yeah, I fell for you


Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 
Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 


All my life, I've been on my own 
I used the light to guide me home 
But now together we're alone 
And there's no other place I'd ever wanna go



Baby, look what you've done


Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, look what you've done  now
Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 

Oh, baby, look what you've done to me
Oh, baby, you got me tied down

Oh, baby, I'll never leave if you keep holding me this way 

Waiting for a girl like you


The light shines, it's getting hot on my shoulders
I don't mind, this time it doesn't matter
'Cause your friends, they look good and you look better


Don't you know all night
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come around, 'round, 'round

Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you


I'm weaker, my worlds fall and they hit the ground
Oh, life, come on 'head, don't you fail me now
I start to say, "I think I love you," but I make no sound


And, oh, 'cause all my life
I've been waiting for a girl like you
To come around


Under the lights tonight, you turned around
And you stole my heart with just one look
When I saw your face, I fell in love
Took a minute, girl, to steal my heart tonight
With just one look, yeah
Been waiting for a girl like you

Written in these walls are the stories that I can't explain
I leave my heart open
But it stays right here empty for days
She told me in the morning
She don't feel the same about us in her bones
It seems to me that when I die
These words will be written on my stone


And I'll be gone, gone tonight 
The ground beneath my feet is open wide 
The way that I've been holding on too tight 
With nothing in between

The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen 
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life 


Written on these walls are the colors that I can't change
Leave my heart open
But it stays right here in its cage
I know that in the morning
I'll see us in the light up on the hill
Although I am broken, my heart is untamed still


And I'll be gone, gone tonight 
The fire beneath my feet is burning bright 
The way that I've been holding on so tight 
With nothing in between


The story of my life, I take her home
I drive all night to keep her warm
And time is frozen 
The story of my life, I give her hope
I spend her love until she's broke inside
The story of my life 

My hands, your hands, tied up like two ships
Drifting, weightless, waves try to break it
I'd do anything to save it
Why is it so hard to save it 
My heart, your heart, sit tight like bookends
Pages between us written with no end
So many words we're not saying
Don't wanna wait 'til it's gone
You make me strong

I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong  Is it so wrong
That you make me strong 


Think of how much love that's been wasted
People always trying to escape it
Move on to stop their heartbreaking
But there's nothing I'm running from
You make me strong


I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong  Is it so wrong 


So, baby, hold on to my heart, oh
Need you to keep me from fallin' apart
I'll always hold on 'cause you make me strong


I'm sorry if I say, "I need ya"
But I don't care, I'm not scared of love
'Cause when I'm not with you, I'm weaker
Is that so wrong  Is it so wrong 

Yeah
Ooh, ooh


Can't believe you're packing your bags
Trying so hard not to cry
Had the best time, and now it's the worst time
But we have to say goodbye


Don't promise that you're gonna write
Don't promise that you'll call
Just promise that you won't forget we had it all

'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember


You were my summer love
You always will be my summer love


Wish that we could be alone now
If we could find some place to hide
Make the last time just like the first time
Push a button and rewind


Don't say the word that's on your lips
Don't look at me that way
Just promise you'll remember when the sky is grey


'Cause you were mine for the summer
Now we know it's nearly over
Feels like snow in September
But I always will remember

I got my first real six-string
Bought it at the five-and-dime
Played it 'til my fingers bled
Was the summer of '69


Oh, when I look back now
That summer seemed to last forever
And if I had the choice
Yeah, I'd always wanna be there
Those were the best days of my life
Oh, yeah
Back in the summer of '69, oh
]
Man, we were killin' time, we were young and restless
We needed to unwind
I guess nothin' can last forever, forever, no
Back in the summer of '69, oh

Back in the summer of '69, oh
Oh yeah
Back in the summer of '69

Now that you can't have me
You suddenly want me
Now that I'm with somebody else
You tell me you love me
I slept on your doorstep
Begging for one chance
Now that I finally moved on
You say that you missed me all along


Who do you think you are 
Who do you think I am 
You only love to see me breakin'
You only want me 'cause I'm taken
You don't really want my heart
No, you just like to know you can
Still be the one who gets it breakin'
You only want me when I'm taken


You're messin' with my head
Girl, that's what you do best
Saying there's nothing you won't do
To get me to say "Yes"
You're impossible to resist
But I wouldn't bet your heart on it
It's like I'm finally awake
And you're just a beautiful mistake

Her name is Noelle
I have a dream about her
She rings my bell
I got gym class in half an hour
Oh how she rocks
In Keds and tube socks
But she doesn't know who I am
And she doesn't give a damn about me


Cause I m just a teenage dirt bag baby
I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me

Her boyfriend's a dick
And he brings a gun to school
And he'd simply kick
My ass if he knew the truth
He lives on my block
And he drives an Iroc
But he doesn't know who I am
And he doesn't give a damn about me


Cause I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
I'm just a teenage dirt bag baby
Listen to Iron Maiden baby with me


Oh, yeah, dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missing
Oh, yeah, dirt bag
No she doesn't know what she's missing


Man I feel like mould
It's prom night and I am lonely
Lo and behold
She's walking over to me
This must be fake
My lip starts to shake
How does she know who I am 
And why does she give a damn about me 

Can't ever get it right
No matter how hard I try, and I've tried
Well, I put up a good fight
But your words cut like knives and I'm tired


As you break my heart again this time


Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Well, you're the charming type
That little twinkle in your eye gets me every time
And, well, there must've been a time
I was the reason for that smile, so keep in mind


As you take what's left of you and I


Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie


Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie
Tell me a lie


Tell me I'm a screwed up mess
That I never listen, listen 
Tell me you don't want my kiss
That you need your distance, distance
Tell me anything, but don't you say
He's what you're missing, baby
If he's the reason that you're leaving me tonight
Spare me what you think and tell me a lie

Saw your body language and I know how you're feelin'
You look like the kind of girl who's tired of speakin'
Standing with somebody, but he doesn't know what you like
You caught my attention, you were looking at me first
Saw that I can teach you waking up in my T-shirt
If you're not hooked to anything right now, I can be your vice


All you need to know is


You can call me when you're lonely
When you can't sleep, I'll be your temporary fix
You control me, even if it's just tonight 
You can call me when you feel like
I'm your good time, I'll be your temporary fix
You can own me, and we'll call this what you like
Let me be your good night


The night is on your lips and I feel like I'm locked in
There's a million lights, I don't care if they're watchin'
Your body's saying everything, I don't have to read your mind
Feel you on my neck while I'm calling a taxi
Climbing over me while I climb in the backseat
Now we're taking off, now we're taking it off tonight

Harry does fall a lot on stage
And he likes women of a certain a-a-age 
We were once five, and now we're four
I fell over playing golf and it was sore-or-or 


Everyone in the world has seen us 
But now we're taking a break


Louis forgets all his words when we're singing
When Liam's phone bleeps it's Simon ringing
Everyone has a 1D doll
Now you know, oh oh, now you know
That's what makes us 1D

People say we shouldn't be together
We're too young to know about forever
But I say, "They don't know
What they talk, talk, talkin' about" 
'Cause this love is only getting stronger
So I don't wanna wait any longer
I just wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl, oh


They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I love you's
But I bet you, if they only knew 
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right 
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us

Just one touch and I was a believer
Every kiss, it gets a little sweeter
It's getting better
Keeps getting better all the time, girl


They don't know about the things we do
They don't know about the I love you's
But I bet you, if they only knew 
They would just be jealous of us
They don't know about the up all nights
They don't know I've waited all my life
Just to find a love that feels this right
Baby, they don't know about, they don't know about us


They don't know how special you are
They don't know what you've done to my heart
They can say anything they want
'Cause they don t know us


They don't know what we do best
That's between me and you, our little secret
But I wanna tell 'em
I wanna tell the world that you're mine, girl

You tell me that you're sad and lost your way
You tell me that your tears are here to stay
But I know you were only hidin'
And I just wanna see ya
You tell me that you're hurt and you're in pain
And I can see your head is held in shame
But I just wanna see you smile again
See you smile again


But don't burn out
Even if you scream and shout
It'll come back to you 
And I'll be here for you


Oh, I will carry you over
Fire and water for your love
And I will hold you closer
Hope your heart is strong enough
When the night is coming down on ya
We will find a way
Through the dark


I wish that I could take you to the start
I'd never let you fall and break your heart
And if you wanna cry or fall apart
I'll be there to hold ya
You tell me that you're hurt, it's all in vain
But I can see your heart can love again
And I remember you laughin'
So let's just laugh again

I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm she came around
She was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
You couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know or seem to care
What your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore


There's nothing left, I used to cry
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

]
I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late
I'm already torn 

I thought I saw a girl brought to life
She was warm, she came around and she was dignified
She showed me what it was to cry
But you couldn't be that girl I adored
You don't seem to know, seem to care what your heart is for
But I don't know her anymore


There's nothing where she used to lie
My conversation has run dry
That's what's going on
Nothing's fine, I'm torn

I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
You're a little late, I'm already torn


And so I guess the fortune teller's right
Should have seen just what was there
And not some holy light
It crawled beneath my veins, and now


I don't care, I had no luck
I don't miss it all that much
There's just so many things
That I can't touch, I'm torn


'Cause I'm all out of faith
This is how I feel
I'm cold and I am shamed
Lying naked on the floor
Illusion never changed
Into something real
I'm wide awake and I can see
The perfect sky is torn
'Cause you're a little late, I'm already torn
 & Liam & ]

Every now and then I get a little bit lonely and you're never coming round

Every now and then I get a little bit tired of listening to the sound of my tears

Every now and then I get a little bit nervous that the best of all the years have gone by

Every now and then I get a little bit terrified and then I see the look in your eyes

Every now and then I fall apart

Every now and then I fall apart


And I need you now tonight
And I need you more than ever
And if you only hold me tight
We'll be holding on forever
And we'll only be making it right
Cause we'll never be wrong
Together we can take it to the end of the line
Your love is like a shadow on me all of the time, all of the time
I don't know what to do when I'm always in the dark
We're living in a powder keg and giving off sparks
I really need you tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight
Forever's gonna start tonight

Listen to the song I wrote
And all these notes I put them there for you
I still taste the time we kissed
Upon my lips, swimming in the blue

It never snows in Hollywood
But when we sang it showed us that it could
I carried you across the way
And you showed me that thirteen can be good


You flipped me upside down
We re both laying on the ground
And I don t even know you
But I feel like I do sometimes
Looking in your eyes
When I see that smile ther  s trouble


So turn around
And I'll hold my hands up
You know i m trouble
I m trouble with you


If I could hav  a hundred things
Not one of them could compare to you
And we could take this anywhere
Cause were we re going
We don t need no shoes

Am I asleep, am I awake or somewhere in between 
I can't believe that you are here and lying next to me
Or did I dream that we were perfectly entwined 
Like branches on a tree or twigs caught on a vine
Like all those days and weeks and months I tried to steal a kiss
And all those sleepless nights and daydreams where I pictured this
I'm just the underdog who finally got the girl
And I am not ashamed to tell it to the world


Truly, madly, deeply, I am foolishly, completely falling
And somehow you kicked all my walls in
So, baby, say you'll always keep me
Truly, madly, crazy, deeply in love with you
In love with you


Should I put coffee and granola on a tray in bed
And wake you up with all the words that I still haven't said 
And tender touches just to show you how I feel
Or should I act so cool, like it was no big deal 
Wish I could freeze this moment in a frame and stay like this
I'll put this day back on replay and keep reliving it
'Cause here s the tragic truth, if you don't feel the same
My heart would fall apart if someone said your name

It feels like we've been living in fast forward
Another moment passing by 
The party's ending, but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight 


Katy Perry's on replay, she's on replay
DJ got the floor to shake, the floor to shake
People going all the way, yeah, all the way
I'm still wide awake


I wanna stay
Up all night and jump around until we see the sun
I wanna stay up all night and find a girl and tell her she's the one
Hold on to the feeling and don't let it go
'Cause we got the floor now, get out of control
I wanna stay up all night and do it all with you


Up, up, up all night like this, all night 
Up all night like this, all night 
Up all night


Don't even care about the table breaking
We only wanna have a laugh 
I'm only thinking 'bout this girl I'm seeing
I hope she'll wanna kiss me back 

It feels like we've been living in fast forward
Another moment passing by 
The party's ending, but it's now or never
Nobody's going home tonight

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


I've been roaming around
Always looking down in all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can't reach
You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah-yeah


Someone like you, and all you know, and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the streets
You know that I could use somebody, yeah
You know that I could use somebody, yeah-yeah


Someone like you
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Off in the night while you live it up, I'm off to sleep
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
Well I hope it's going to make you notice
Well I hope it's going to make you notice

Well sometimes I go out by myself
And I look across the water
And I think of all the things what you're doing
And in my head I paint a picture


Well since you've come on home
Well my body's been a mess
I miss your ginger hair
And the way you like to dress

Won't you come on over 
Stop making a fool out of me
So why don't you come on over, Valerie 


Valerie!
Valerie!
Valerie!


Why don't you come on over, Valerie 
There once was a group with Liam and Niall
Vas Happening boys  Vas Happening boys 
They lived with Zayn and their room was vile
Vas Happening boys  Vas Happening boys 

Did you know Harry's such a slob 
He needs to win X Factor cause he can't get a job

And, oh, Louis needs a boat
He dresses like he owns one
Cause he's got no other clothes
They really need your vote

Vas Happening boys  Vas Happening boys 



Mick Jagger could be Harry's dad
Vas Happening mum  Vas Happening Mick 
When Liam sings he makes his face look sad
Vas Happening song  Vas Happening sad 

And Zayn's the master of echoes 
And Niall was raised by leprechauns so he won't ever grow

And, oh, Louis needs that boat
He dresses like he owns one
And it's becoming a joke
They really need your vote

I used to rule the world
Seas would rise when I gave the word
Now in the morning I sleep alone
Sweep the streets I used to own


I used to roll the dice
Feel the fear in my enemy's eyes
Listened as the crowd would sing
"Now the old king is dead, long live the king"
One minute I held the key
Next the walls were closed on me
And I discovered that my castle stands
Upon pillars of salt, pillars of sand


I hear Jerusalem bells ringing
Roman cavalry choirs are singing
Be my mirror, my sword, and shield
My missionaries in the foreign field
For some reason I can't explain
Once you go, there was never, never an honest world
But that was when I ruled the world


Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh, oh

A week ago, you said to me
"Do you believe I'll never be too far "
If you're lost, just look for me
You'll find me in the region of the summer stars
The fact that we can sit right here and say goodbye
Means we've already won
A necessity for apologies between you and me
Baby, there is none


Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we 
Ah-ooh, we had some good tricks up our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again

And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind


Yesterday, I went out
To celebrate the birthday of a friend
But as we raised our glasses up to make a toast
I realised you were missing


Ah-ooh, we had some good times, didn't we 
Ah-ooh, we wore our hearts out on our sleeve
Ah-ooh, goodbyes are bittersweet
But it's not the end, I'll see your face again


And you will find me
Yeah, you will find me
In places that we've never been
For reasons we don't understand
Walking in the wind
Walking in the wind

Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching her dance, dress is catching the light
In her eyes, there's no lies, no lies
There's no question, she's not in a disguise


With no way out and a long way down
Everybody needs someone around
But I can't hold you too close now
Through the wire, through the wire


What a feeling to be right here beside you now
Holding you in my arms
When the air ran out and we both started running wild
The sky fell down
But you've got stars in your eyes
And I've got something missing tonight
What a feeling to be a king beside you, somehow
I wish I could be there now


Through the wire, through the wire, through the wire
I'm watching you like this, imaginin' you're mine
It's too late, it's too late, am I too late 
Tell me now, am I running out of time 

This letter s  U 
You know it s true
It starts some words, there are more then a few


U starts  Uhh,  and  Ugh,  and  Up, 
U starts Udon, there s some in this cup


Twenty-six letters are in the alphabet
But we re here to sing about  U 


U, you begin the word ukulele
U, there s a UFO flying by me
U, when you re gone I feel so unhappy
I love U
U, you know, you re so useful

U for unique, that s a unique gown
U, check it out, Elmo s upside-down
U, there s a unicorn dressed as a clown
Letter U, that s what makes U so useful
That s what makes U so useful

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turnin' heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up 
Bein' the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, oh-oh, you don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
That's what makes you beautiful

So c-come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right, I put it in a song
I don't know why you're being shy
And turn away when I look into your eyes


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

Counted all my mistakes and there's only one
Standin' out from the list of the things I've done
All the rest of my crimes don't come close
To the look on your face when I let you go
So, I built you a house from a broken home
Then I wrote you a song with the words you spoke
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down


Now, I'm searchin' every lonely place
Every corner, callin' out your name
Tryna find you, but I just don't know
Where do broken hearts go 
Where do broken hearts go 


Yeah, the taste of your lips on the tip of my tongue
Is at the top of the list of the things I want
Mind is runnin' in circles of you and me
Anyone in-between is the enemy
Shadows come with the pain that you're runnin' from
Love was something you never heard enough
Yeah, it took me some time, but I figured out
How to fix up a heart that I let down

I know you want, know you wanna take it slow
Think about all the places we could go
If you give in tonight, just let me set you free
We'll touch the other side, just give me the key


'Cause we got all night
And we're going nowhere
Why don't you stay 
Why don't we go there 
Let's take a ride
Out in the cold air
I know the way
Why don't you go there with me 


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh


Say the word, say the word but don't say no
Sky dive, you and I with just these clothes
Your secret's safe with me, there's no right time or place
'Cause anyone could see we'd do it anyway

I'm wishin' on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means


And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishin' on tomorrow, praying it'll come
And I'm wishin' on all the lovin' we've ever done

I never thought I'd see
A time when you would be
So far away from home
So far away from me
Just think of all the moments that we spent
I just can't let you go, for me you were meant
And I didn't mean to hurt you, but I know
That in the game of lovin', you reap what you sow


I feel it's time we should make up, baby
I feel it's time for us to get back together
And make the best of things, oh, baby, when we're together
Whether or never


I'm wishing on a star
To follow where you are
I'm wishin' on a dream
To follow what it means


And I wish on all the rainbows that I see
I wish on all the people who really dream
And I'm wishin' on tomorrow, praying it'll come
And I'm wishin' on all the lovin' we've ever done

I hear them calling for you 
I hear them calling for you


I feel the waves getting started
It's a rush inside I can't control
Your eyes keep pulling me in
And I know, I know, I know
Your friends all talking 'bout me
They say I got no chance at all
But your fire is burning deep
In my soul, my soul, my soul

I ain't up for debating
Ain't in it for the taking
You got the whole world shaking


In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark
One by one, I try to take them down
We can run and hide, ain't going down without a fight
 I hear them calling for you
 I hear them callin'
In the middle of the night when the wolves come out
Headed straight for your heart, they come straight for your heart
Ooh, I hear them calling for you
Ooh, I hear them calling for you


I keep on holding tight now
'Cause your body's telling me "don't let go"
We're gonna be starting up trouble
I know, I know, I know
Just bringing my demons out
More than ever now
Your beauty could start a war
As you walk in the door

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you shoulda somehow realised what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now


Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before, but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now


And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how 


Because maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall


Today was gonna be the day, but they'll never throw it back to you
By now, you should've somehow realised what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now 

You are so beautiful
To me
You are so beautiful
To me
Can't you see, oh oh


You're everything I hope for
You're everything I need, yeah
You are so beautiful to me


You are so beautiful
To me
Can't you see, oh yeah
You're everything I hope for
You're every, everything I need
You are so beautiful to me
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white
Seconds and hours
Maybe they had to take some time
I know how it goes
I know how it goes from wrong and right
Silence and sound
Did they ever hold each other tight like us 
Did they ever fight like us 

You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us
No, nothing can come between you and I


Oh, you and I


I figured it out
Saw the mistakes of up and down
Meet in the middle
There's always room for common ground
I see what it's like
I see what it's like for day and night
Never together
'Cause they see things in a different light like us
But they never tried like us


You and I
We don't wanna be like them
We can make it till the end
Nothing can come between you and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us

You and I, we don't wanna be like them
We can make it 'til the end
You and I
Not even the Gods above
Can separate the two of us

Nothing can come between you and I
Cause you and I
You and I


We don't wanna be like them
We can make it to the end
Nothing can come in between
I figured it out
Seconds and hours
I know how it goes
Silence and sound
Tight like us


You and I
We can make it 'til the end
You and I
Can separate the two of us
You and I

I figured it out
Meet in the middle
I see what it's like
Never together
Like us


You and I
We can make it 'til the end
You and I
Can separate the two of us

'Cause you and I
We don't wanna be like them
Nothing can come between you and I
Can separate the two of us 
You and I
Oh, you and I
We could make it if we try, you and I
I figured it out
I figured it out from black and white

You're insecure
So half of four
Your old brains are not what they were before


Add two threes. It's fun for us
Cause we're young and we can still remember stuff


Everyone else can multiply by sixty
Everyone else can add two


Now take off one hundred, and add on 24
Then divide by two and add on seven more
And if you're struggling now it's not hard to tell
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible

If only you had a mind like me
You'd understand how to divide the sum by three
And then just add on the age of this OAP
You don't know, oh, oh, your math skills are terrible, oh, oh


It's really kind of pitiful
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live


And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that
I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world


I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss for you
Well, a few of the verses, well, they've got me quite cross
Well the sun's been quite kind
While I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that
I put down in words
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words 
How wonderful life is while you're in the worldMy life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined
But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band
I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart
I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight
I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall
I know they will continue to be the best band in the world
