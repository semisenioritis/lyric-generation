.
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


This the type of shit we used to dream of 
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa 
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza 
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now "
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights


Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter 
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
 2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent 
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world


Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded 
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
Something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
And then

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


What do you reckon, is it just me 
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break

We can stay up till the sunrise, kick it in the late night
Just you and me, don't have to be shy, baby
Don't be shy, baby
It's a time like this, baby
Free my mind with a kiss, I'm in bliss
Yeah, this is Heaven, baby
And I don't wanna miss what we have right now
So tell me, would you stay up  
Late night, talkin' till we make trust 
Baby, tell me, would you be the one, be my one

Slow down when I can't feel myself
Looking right but knowing that there's nothing left
So slow wine for the sour grapes
'Cause moving on isn't up for debate
I still wonder where the time's gone 
Sometimes I don't wanna be strong 
With all these expectations of what I should be
CC'd in so many threads that I can't see me
Even when I'm struggling
I bless my enemies so much they feel they owe me something
Shatter pains like ceilings, even when I barely function
It's wahala but mahalo
Got my two-step, so the beat's the only thing I have to follow, uh

Quando mi dai poco voglio troppo da te, per 
Quando mi dai troppo non capisco cos' 
Vorrei sparire di botto
Come la pioggia d'agosto
Poi dimostrarti che torno
In fondo l'amore   il ritorno, per 
Siediti che ti racconto
Come si pu  nella vita stare in piedi
Senza che nessuno paghi per te il conto
Ed esser oggi quel che tu sognavi ieri 
Come ho fatto a non vederlo nei miei occhi
Che ho gi  dentro quel che io cercavo fuori 
Dai, sar  che c'ho il destino in tasca

I don't see nobody in here but us, for real, for you I'm blind
We go anywhere, don't take much for us to catch a vibe
Come here, I need to tell you somethin', let me whisper in your ear
Do whatever to get you there, I'll put you on a Lear, yeah
Private island for a month straight, they'll think you disappeared
Lamb truck'll look good on you, I'm coppin' you that Urus
I think I'm 'bout ready to make love in this club
Only thing I need is my drink and my drugs
I done got on ten and forgot where I was
Some parts I don't like, but this part I love
Only me and my guys

But he's just hopin' he's enough, feel like me, we had it hard
So we learned to adjust and take th  smooth with the rough
Your skin's smooth to the touch, I got juice in my cup
Sh  know I ain't like them fools in the club
I'm grindin' so we got a house on the hill
A boat for the cane and a pool for the a tub
'Til then I'm two-steppin' in the mud

We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all


Night, night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
Night, yeah
All we need is us


What do you reckon, is it just me 
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best, and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat


'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace, stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break, something's gotta change
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and

I think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again


And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home

Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone


But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home


So please come home
Things were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that Heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way, I'll cry with the rest of them


And my father told me "Son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing


Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love




Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again


We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears


Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow


The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I

Like Kendrick Lamar, this shit ain't free
It's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too 
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam 
You're the song my heart is beating to


So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home


And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From AmericaNone
Chicago on a Friday night
I was walking from a bar with a friend of mine
We heard sirens and saw blue lights
Right in front of us
Seems her man took another mans life
I can search a wrong and never make a right
What's worst by the end of the night 
There'll be somethin' else, somewhere else
As the sun sets over the hills
In Los Angeles and New York
Somebody's tryna find a place to sleep
But daddy's lookin for daughter down in New Orleans tonight

Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America


Miami on a Saturday night
Drinks are flowing all around and the pad is wide
Hope is low but the heels are high
Yeah, this town's alive, oh, na-na
She only wanted to feel some love
Didn't get much when she was growin' up
Men tried but they were never enough
She needs somethin' else or somewhere else
And in Vegas, someone's gamblin'
A family dream are two roads down
Her mother lives in poverty, hopin' her soldiers on a call
And say, "Mama, I'm fine."


Hey man, just one more night in America
Hey man, just one more night in America


Every time I'm here, everywhere I go
I can see the beauty, I can feel the hope
Oh, and some folks try, some folks cry
Some folks die for the stars and stripes

I woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Caf  clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight


I drill you deep into my chest
That s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone

Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won t you sing me another song


Caf  clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes


With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone


Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won t you sing me another song

Another day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you 
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated


Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you 
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me


Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay


Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you 
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me

Oh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That somethin' wasn't right here 
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah


Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because

My loneliness is killin' me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time


Oh, baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothin' that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it


Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because


My loneliness is killin' me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Gimme a sign
Hit me, baby, one more time

Saturday, me and my girlfriend are at a party in the West End
And I don't really know nobody here either
Maybe we should've stayed home
And turned down the lights so low
Open up a  Bordeaux, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow


She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here 
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said

Hey, let's leave this party 
Back to my apartment 
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


I'm still here with my best friend and I'm not
Disappointed that the party
We just can't fit in with the West End crowd
Can't even hear their conversations, so
Baby, let's hit the road and open up a  Margot, mmm
And put on a jam so slow, so slow


She said, "All the girls here are beautiful"
But baby, no one around comes close to you
And that's the honest truth
Why are we even here 
'Cause all the boys got their eyes on you
For the same reason that my eyes are too
And that's when she made her move
And whispered in my ear and said


Hey, let's leave this party 
Back to my apartment 
There's no one here that I know
So take my hand, I want to go
And get this party started back at home


Ooh, ooh


Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's tru , it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits lead to you
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
My bad habits l ad to you


Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know

Feds havin' nightmares when I got my ice
Gyal up on my left side, gyal up on my right 
Six figure transfer when I cop my ride 
That's why the opps them just wanna take my life
Before the music, had to put a shift in 
Made Lambo money from a Citr en 
I was tapped then, rolling with my kitchen
That's why they want me just lock up in th  system
Bad habits in my life, in my veins 
Bad habits in the nine with a babe 
Bad habits, can't end up with a case
Man, them bad vibes just haffi go away
'Cause I was broke, getting Ps weren't easy 
I'm with Sheeran now, it's cheeky 
Feds can't believe I'm on TV
They're havin' flashbacks of CCTV
Tough luck , he got brucked up 
In my drop-top , getting top-top 
And my young buck, if he catch an opp-opp
No Double-E ting, bidda-bop-bop 
But fuck what you're tellin' 'em , I'm from Edmonton 
Bad vibes everyting ****
Rolex or I might bust it on skeleton 


I don't wanna go on a mad one
Them say somethin' I can't come back from
Frontways, sideways, cowgirl, backshots
Mr. Miyagi, wax off, wax on
I don't even smoke, she want a backstrap one
Messed up with my good girl and a sad one
Now I'm in a hotel room with a bad one
Strapped up, I don't wanna give mum a grandson
These ladies moving crazy, uh
Wanna have babies by me
Lately I've been keepin' my head down
Ain't been wildin', takin' time out
Cards laid out, got nothin' to hide 'bout
Ayy, maybe I slipped up once on a night out
If she find out 'bout that, she wild out
The sex feel better when you make up
After you break up, all body language
Don't wanna say much
We could go back to the AP and lay up
Or fuck in the back of the Bentley Bentayga
Come home late, she wake, she stayin' up
Body intact, no personal trainer
Breakfast in bed, don't cook me no bacon
I just want head when I wake up

Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control

And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you

Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far

Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't

Woo-ooh, ooh-ooh

Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful

Well get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it


And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street


In Barcelona
Barcelona

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente

We are, we are, we are

Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear

Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you


I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you


Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong 
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on


And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you
Be my husband I'll be your wife
Be my husband I'll be your wife
Be my husband I'll be your wife
Love and honor you for all your life
Singin'...

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Woah daddy now now love me good
Now...
If you promise me you'll be my man
If you promise me you'll be my man
If you promise me you'll be my man
I will love you the best I can yeah
Singin'...

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Woah daddy now now love me good

If you want me to cook and sew
If you want me to cook and sew

Outside you there is no place to go
Singin'...

Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Oh daddy now now love me good
Woah daddy now now love me good
Now

Stick the promise man that you made me

Stick the promise man that you made me yeah
That you won't go fooling with that Rosalie
Singin'...

A lifetime is startin' to feel like
It's fallin' short of the mark
But it's all that we got
Every teardrop, every wrong turn
Made the moment we found
And it's comin' around, around, around, around, around


I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now

The shadows cling to the ceiling
And fracture the light
That lands in our eyes
Every moment changes the whole view
And just when it ends
I feel it again, again, again, again, again


I don't wanna miss one thing
We can turn the whole world down
And listen to the in-between
We are, we are the sound
There's nothin' but the space we're in
The hurry and the noise shut out
Just stay here and be right now


Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Stay here and be right now
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Nothin' else matters
Just stay here and be right now

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else 
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me 
'Cause I don't even love myself

Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet


But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else 
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you


With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum

My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too


But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else 
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me 
'Cause I don't even love myself


Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you


I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet

Just lay it all down on me
It s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me


And you know I ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose 
You find my heart is hard to break
Can t keep playing the fool

Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what s there beyond the pale


I feel like I ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do 






What can I do
Just to let you know
That you re in my mind 
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every time
Bibia be ye ye


I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day

Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye


I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day


Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Wo nooma 
Wo nooma maaaa ye

Mr. Ruskin, come and paint my picture
We're losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who's your best friend  Can you introduce me 
See, I can't seem to even let you breathe


When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me

Come and show me if you can
See I know you're me, but I can't seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It's psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quick


When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind's eye
Please let me forget that I'm standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
I've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinnin' on my mind
Sippin' on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded 
How'd I get so faded 
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn 
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Lyrics from Live Performance


I came in for the embers
And stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
When do I breathe 
Oh, I know

The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't, but the wav s won't break my boat
But the waves won't br ak my boat


Stones crashed on the boardwalk
Wind rushed through the trees
I'll keep my eyes peeled
Memories always fall short
With what we could've been
Let the longed for last call
What do I need 
Oh, I know


The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
Maybe I won't, but the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat


But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't break my boat

I want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over


I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need

Don't want your advice
'Cause I've made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I've heard it before
So don't try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who's pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It's no surprise
That you'd wanna waste your time


I'm a fly upon your neck
You can't control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I needLyrics from Live debut


Sadness always finds a man
Seeks it's way by, infecting everything
And every chapter has an end
But this is one I've learned to seek, hold on to them


And the black birds, they fly
Like I fell on the skyline

But I, I fear
Running from the light
Engulfed in darkness
Sharing my eyes
Wondering why I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I


'Cause I should take this, I'm a champ
But I don't even know how all of this began
And we are made to mourn and then
How can I wish for nothing when it's still the same 


But now I fear
Running from the light
Engulfed in darkness
Sharing my eyes
Wondering why I'm stuck on the borderline
Which way will I


Tears never run
There's no such way
We are so low
We're on the borderline
We're on the borderline

I think I took too much
Credit card and rolled up dollar bill
On a hotel table
I don't know where they went
I've lost all of my pride
Washed down with another pill
But I've been so complacent
I don't know where them days went


Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama
I've spent a while on the brink
I've never felt so cold
I can't feel my heart beating
My lord, bring me back to life
I know I lost my soul
Where's my God when I need him
My lord, bring me back to life

Roll one and light it up
These purple clouds could set the alarm off
Police come and take me
Maybe that would save me
You know I've had my share of drinking, drugs, and women who
Who love you 'cause you're famous
But I guess that I can't blame them


Well I broke my own heart tonight, mama
Now I'm coughing up blood in the sink
And if I take my life don't cry for me, mama
It's been a while on the brink
I've never felt so cold
Can you see my eyes fading 
My lord, bring me back to life
White powder in my nose
Where's my God when I need him  
My Lord, bring me back to life


For every time that I've been high
And when I made my mom cry
Oh Lord, bring me back to life
For all the women that have been my love
Heartbroken in an instant
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the friends that I don't see
And the people could think they know me
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the drugs that I've taken
Sitting in a strangers basement
My Lord, bring me back to life
For all the memories I don't want
'Cause I got nothing to show for
Oh Lord, bring me back to life
And I don't want any of this
And I don't want any of this
I don't want
Oh Lord, bring me back to lifeNoneFull lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heartNoneGoodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did

Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played

And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you

More than just our Marilyn Monroe

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home

I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down

We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill


One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by

You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again


I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds


You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
Celestial
Cel stial


I see the light shining through the rain
A thousand colours in a brighter shad 
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's silver lining that surrounds the grey

We'll do it all
Everything
On our own
We don't need
Anything or anyone


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world 

I don't quite know
How to say
How I feel
Those three words
Are said too much
They're not enough


If I lay here
If I just lay here
Would you lie with me and just forget the world 
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life


Let's waste time
Chasing cars
Around our heads
I need your grace
To remind m 
To find my own


If I lay here
If I just lay her 
Would you lie with me and just forget the world 
Forget what we're told
Before we get too old
Show me a garden that's burstin' into life

She's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke


You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to


'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough 


Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to

Oh, yeah, we been in the rain
Been on the rocks, but we found our way
We've ordered pizza to an aeroplane
Slept on the beach like we were castaways
We been in the storm
Been to an Irish bar in central Rome
Driven to hospitals with broken bones
We've shared a toothbrush and shared our home
We've seen the moon reflect on the rollin' tide
Been up at 5AM, watchin' the sunrise
Because the world looks b tter when I'm by your side
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Wh n you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life
When you and I collide
You bring me to life
Yeah, you bring me to life
You bring me to life


We been on the road
We've watched the blossom fall to Earth like snow
Fumbled in cubicles in Tokyo
And been to funerals in rented clothes
Mmm, we drank your father's whiskey when your grandma died
You brought me to the morning through my darkest night
Yeah, the world hurts less when I'm by your side
Oh, I, oh, I, oh I
Lyrics from Live debut


Kaleidoscope love, yeah, that is you and me
Forever changing, we make life interesting
Some days we're red and, some days we both ain't green
But I like the nights when we leave the canvas free


Grab a brush and see where the feeling may lead
Nothing is out of our reach
Your words are flecks in each pigment we need
Can we get started 


I keep falling, deeper and dark blue
Bright r than white
The wind goes,  xploding
But I can't see nothing since you and your eyes
Maybe we'll just paint the night colourblind


In every spectrum, we find a million of pics
Connect the dots and everything in between
Mm, don't leave the moment, you turn it gold and leave
You take the dark away, and that's on easy feet
None
Standing at the bar
And your eyes are telling me come closer
But if you could see me dance
There's no way that you would let me hold ya
I feel you pulling on my hand more
And dragging me to the dance floor
All my inhibitions fall away
Feel the rhythm of the track
And telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say


Softly do you feel that you could love me
And want me
More than anybody else
But then again


It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go

I'm coming down, coming home
Not  cause I left without my coat
There's just some things you need to know, know, know
Your eyes, they are a window to your soul
It's such a lovely place to go
Think I should tell you more, you know, know, know


But now I m older
Drips are coming off my shoulder
All I need is closure
On what you said to me
'Cause I

I can never be mad with you, baby
'Cause the love that we have is amazing
You drive me  crazy 
But that ain't a bad thing, no, no, no
I can never be mad, mad, mad
I can never be mad


Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


No, I don't really want to fight
Let's keep the conversation light
Spark th  candles, pour the wine-in -ine
My father gave me good advice
Sort out your problems by the time
That you finally close your eyes at night


But now I'm older
Drips are coming off my shoulder
All I need its closure
On what you said to me
'Cause I

Lyrics from Live debut


Can you pull the curtains  Let me see the sun shine
I think I'm done with my hiding place
And you found my anyway
It's been forever but I'm feeling alright
Tears dry, we'll leave no trace
And tomorrow's another day


Hide and seek
I am somewhere close away
You won't leave
How long it's been since we started the game 
I can't be seen
And you won't find me today
I can't be
This love, I'll be okay


"Are you alright " Baby, don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
The inside, see, I always go back
And I always will, obviously
Is it in your childhood  see, there's nothing in your past
But the sadness, promise that it won't last
And the back hurt, I'm tryna take it all back
And there's still more underneath
And that's when you say to me

Your love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight


If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why

I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words


And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Oooh, I'm overdue
Give me some room, coming through
Paid my dues, I'm in the mood
Me and my girls gonna shake the room

DJ spinning, show your hands
Let's get dirrty, that's my jam
I need that, uh to get me off
Sweating until my clothes come off
It's explosive, speakers are thumping
Still jumping, 6 in the morning
Table dancing, glasses are crashing
No question, time for some action
Temperature's up , 'bout to erupt
Gonna get my girls, get your boys, gonna make some noise

Gonna get rowdy
Gonna get a little unruly
Get it fired up in a hurry
Wanna get dirrty
It's about time that I came to start the party
Sweat dripping over my body
Dancing, getting just a little naughty
Wanna get dirrty, it's about time for my arrival

Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm, and I'm trowin' elbows
Ring the alarm...

Ah, heat is up
Ladies, fellas drop your cups
Bodies packed, front to back
Move your arse; I like that

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake

So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you


You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history  
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on 
'Cause I heard you do, mmm


I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take


So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you

I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing

Don't  with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't  with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But, me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should ve just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what its about
But maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How !
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love

I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love

Ah lahmlahlah

Hit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left

I'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever 
How can I be at my best with this pressure 
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, 
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out


You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking 
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking  I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken 
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy survive
I'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
Oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track

Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out

You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like, "When you leaving me "
Should I  Should I 


Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love


I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then  Keep it between friends 
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed

I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to

I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk


Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk


I wanna hold your heart in both hands

I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk


Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk

I've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby  I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby  I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you

We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen "
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love

And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
None
Drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love






Drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love




I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing

I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to

There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore

On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me

Should I, should I

Lyrics from Live performance


I heard you calling, now my eyes were open
The day's breaking in the power blue
Sunlight's framing now in every morning
What a way to start off the day with you


Think of floating
I start a discussion to pick a singer
This one will do, I had to bring her
Just at the speaker, still give away

And drop the needle on Dusty
Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night but I gotta a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in no time
Now we gotta wait till the clothes are in time
So I drop the needle on Dusty


I'll leave the lust with you, lost in the ocean
Nobody know what you're going through
You talk about it as if I chose you
Take a breathe and grace following with you


I'll flick a vinyl
Before the magic to do his thing, yeah
There's more than sadness we got within us
Let's put some colour into the grey


And drop the needle on Dusty
Crossed on leaves, the moment came out of nowhere
A beautiful smile on your face
Yesterday was a long night but I gotta a feeling that the future is so bright
All of the pressure washed away in no time
Now we gotta wait till the clothes are in time
So I drop the needle on Dusty
I'm just a bachelor, lookin' for a partner
And someone who knows how to ride without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible and takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off, I promise that you won't wanna get off

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
I'm sittin' here flossin', peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance, the things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
I send shivers up and down your spine, and fluids flowin' down your thigh

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it

Wanna get freaky baby
And feel you next to me
And you can join my jockey team 

Wanna get nasty baby
And feel you next to me 
And you can join my jockey team 

If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony

"Shivers"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh

So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areLyrics from Live debut


I've been depressed since you left, try to the fill the hole with wine
Stop the drugs when she came, cleaned my act overnight
If you reach with no reply, see you when I see your man
You can't talk to me through the phone if we don't a fucking line
I try to grow but the past, it tears me down to side
There's still the world out to process but don't take the same advice
I remember what I sang, that the morning's filled with fear
Can't get a handle of my grief, when I remember it turns to tears

It's been a long year and we're not even halfway there


Is this the end of your life  When pain starts taking over
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's falling apart, our love is real, it never closes
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but be alone
We spend our youth with our losing hearts wide open
And in the dark, it's in the next, the end of youth


I've been lost since the tears but the time's all alright
On my own, slip and falls, I have been trying with my life
Just a boy who can't stop feelings all coming in
You were meant to be my friend and now it's a shame that you can't
It's the age to create, gotta remember you
No one knows what they want, just give you what I feel
And I'm still feeling higher, all alone is always near
When I'm down but I never see you, when I'm up you are up here


It's been a long year and we're not even halfway wait


Is this the end of your life  When pain starts taking over
I just don't know if I can ever just let it go
Everything's falling apart, our love is real, it never closes
I guess it's all part of life, but I can't help but be alone
We spend our youth with our losing hearts wide open
And in the dark, it's in the next, the end of youth
None
Across the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me


So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose

I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me


I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose


I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"


And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see

I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more


Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow

I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it 
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away

It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside, we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on
So live life like you re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
Live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
I didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight 
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight 


And I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, yeah

'Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are


I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, woah, I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight


Oh, I will stop trying to fall in love again and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
'Cause you are the only one for me, hmm, yeah


And maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
Oh, maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you are

I know it's a bad idea
But how can I help myself 
Been inside for most this year
And I thought a few drinks, they might help
It's been a while, my dear
Dealin' with the cards life dealt
I'm still holdin' back these tears
While my friends are somewhere else
I pictured this year a little bit different when it hit February
I step in the bar, it hit me so hard, oh, how can it be this heavy 
Every song reminds me you're gone and I feel th  lump form in my throat
'Cause I'm here alon 

Just dancin' with my eyes closed
'Cause everywhere I look, I still see you
And time is movin' so slow
And I don't know what else that I can do
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Eye-eye-eye-eyes
Eye-eye-eye-eyes closed
Eye-eye-eye-eyes
So I'll keep dancin' with my


Delusion is here again
And I think you'll come home soon
A word brings me right back in
Then it's only me that's in this room
I guess I could just pretend
The colours are more than blue
But I lost more than my friend
I can't help but missin' you 


I pictured this month a little bit different, no one is ever ready
And when it unfolds, you get in a hole, oh, how can it be this heavy 
Everything changes, nothing's the same, except the truth is now you're gone
And life just goes on
None

Eu sei que   uma m  ideia
Mas como posso me segurar
Estive em casa a maior parte desse ano
E pensei que algumas bebidas poderiam me ajudar
Faz um tempo meu querido
Lidando com as cartas que a vida deu
Ainda estou segurando essas l grimas
Enquanto meus amigos est o em outro lugar


Eu imaginei esse ano um pouco diferente
At  que chegou fevereiro
Eu pisei no bar, me acertou em ch io
Como pode isso ser t o pesado 
Todas as m sicas m  lembram que voc  se foi
E eu sinto um n  se formando na minha garganta
Porque estou aqui sozinho

S  dan ando com os olhos fechados
Porque todo lugar que olho ainda vejo voc 
E o tempo est  passando t o devagar
E eu n o sei o que mais posso fazer
Ent o eu continuo dan ando de olhos fechados


A desilus o est  aqui de novo
E eu penso que voc  vai voltar para casa em breve
Uma palavra me traz de volta
Ent o sou apenas eu que estou neste quarto
Eu acho que poderia apenas fingir
Que as cores s o mais que azul
Mas eu perdi mais que meu amigo
N o posso deixar de sentir sua falta


Eu imaginei este m s um pouco diferente
Ningu m est  preparado
E quando se desenrola voc  entra em um buraco
Como isso pode ser t o pesado 
Tudo muda, nada   o mesmo
Exceto a verdade que agora voc  se foi
E a vida apenas continua

Yo, Jam, this is a letter to you
It's been a while, but it's been hard for me to get in the booth
And since we last spoke, I've become a father of two
Tryna live life with a smile, but that's been harder to do
'Cause all I wanna do is talk about you
But these tears won't let me talk about you
We should've known that we'd be lost without you
Therapy sessions, diggin' deep in depression
I got a life full of blessings, but this just breaks my fuckin' heart
At your birthday, couldn't even crack a smile
I just cried and left the party, Neesh, I'll see you in while
Headed to the mural, got some jerk wings and plantain
'Cause that is the way that me and you would celebrate it
I never knew you touched the stuff, 'cause you'd always bad me up
If you saw me more than drunk, you always hated what it does
Before Lyra, I just stopped, I haven't even wanted one
I can't get over this, it's fucked, man, I wished I'd known
And yo, we cried for nine nights in your family home
Laid you to rest in the ground but without a stone
You know it hits me most at moments now when I'm alone
Every morning, I remember that you're really gone

'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
You know for life, got your sis and mother
And day and night, it still hits that you're gone
And right now I'm spillin' tears in my cup
You left the world 'fore you met Jupiter
Wish you'd have known you would be godfather
You would've loved lovin' my little girls
If not for them, I'd be done with the world


Was there two hours after you passed
Speedin' east to west, silent in the back of the car
Was at your mum's, there all week, tryna make sense but I can't
And although it's been a year, still feel the pain in my heart
'Cause you were there from the start
The day we met, yeah, I moved in and we were never apart
People assumed that we were lovers, but we're brothers in arms
Symbiotic bond of love and gave each other a chance, my god, ah
Fuck sake
Lately I've been cryin' so much, my lungs ache
Teardrops all over my shirt like blood stains
And I know to heal a heart, it must break
But I'm done prayin', they
Gave me a shovel at your burial
And watchin' you get lowered is somethin' I can't forget at all
And people find and stop me in the street and say it's terrible
But they don't know you like I knew you and they never will
No one saw the nights turn into day when we were battle rappin'
No one saw the belly laugh, and every train to somewhere random
No one saw the holidays, and then our first experience clubbin'
No one knew the things you did for me and never asked for nothin'
No one read the conversations of the moves that we were plannin'
No one knew about the way you felt the scene, left you abandoned
No one knew about your fears 'cause you would hide 'em with a smile
No one knew when people took an inch, you would give 'em a mile
'Cause that was always Jamal, SB to the crowd
They used to shout your net worth, but they don't mention it now
They hear about your good deeds and infectious smile
A golden heart that's still remembered is worth more than a crown
I promised sixty-four bars and now I keep it to Tanisha
Mummy, Isaac, the gang, but I just wish that you'd seen it
I can't accept that you're gone, or the grief that I'm feeling
I prayed to God for answers, but He still won't give me a reason
I think about you every day, nothing will take this pain away
I'll keep your legacy amazin', mate
The conversations at your grave's the only way to be close
I know you'll greet me with a smile on the day that I go

You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We re drifting
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too 

You and I
We re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We re lifted
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too 
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too 


Would you fall too 
Would you fall too 
Would you fall too 
Would you fall too In hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know

Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart

But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down

Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

None
You and I, two of a mind
This love's one of a kind
You and I, we're drifting
Over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too 

You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I we're drifting over the edge


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too 


And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too 


Would you fall too 
Would you fall too 
Would you fall too 
Would you fall too 
Hmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps


I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a M gane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again

See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go


To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps


Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in 
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up
None
Ba-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet


Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah 
I waited most my life for somethin' real 
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya

Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel 
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy


Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah 
I waited most my life for somethin' real

Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya


Used to be Playboy heartbreaker
But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers 
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas 
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin 
This love give you protein and vitamin 
See you wigglin', jigglin' 
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon  
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

The rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor


And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call

We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms


And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving 








And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you call
What I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes


Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe


There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes

I fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep


And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe

There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
I thought it'd feel different playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man 
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember

The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight, and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm


The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin' ", and I just said, "Please"


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man 
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember


The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Mmm, mmm


Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man 
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember


Ooooh darlin' 



Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.

With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...


Forever,
is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

Ooooh darlin' 



I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...

I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.



Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.

We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong 
And heaven knows, no one wants it to


So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know

Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you


We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through


So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know


Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you
I m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it
And I rang you up to check how you ve done
And your eyes shine like gold from the sun to me
And I hear that you have messed it all up again
I ll be right there to catch you
Like I m gonna catch this train
And I ll always be here you know
I will love your smile and love your way
As long as you can let it show
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I ll walk away
It s a game they play
If I m shot down in the crossfire
I can t wait
And she can t drive yet
But she can drive me to a point of mental craze
And she will wind me up
She s the sort of girl that keeps you hanging on and on for days
And I
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in a crossfire
All that I can say
Is I ll walk away
It s a game they play
If I m shot down in the crossfire
I can t wait
Broken hearted
I ve departed
To a place I feel more comfortable
And I belong here
Don t shed no tear
Just remember I ll be back again
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
I can t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I ll walk away
Its a game they play
If I m shot down in the crossfire
I m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"


I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm 
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on 
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance

You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the c ili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand

Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl


And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
None
Give me love like her
'Cause lately, I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
My-my, my-my-y, give me love


Give me love like never before
'Cause lately, I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight, I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol, mm-mmh
No, I just wanna hold ya


Give a little time to me or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My-my, my-my-y, oh, give me love
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow

And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya

Give a little time to me 
We'll play hide and seek 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love

My my, my my
Give me love
My my, my my
Give me love
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love

Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me love


As youths we used to play games
Like hide and seek and Simon Says
And then we realized we re not mice, we re men
And that was kinda dead
For one more time, let s play Simon Says
But this time, it s not Simon,  cause Simon s Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
Like it meant your final breath, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time, so it don t matter if you re poor or not
Give me that real love, something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya, just like the first time you said it
Give me love cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It s like I finally see the person in my reflection
Check
On a late night
We were outside
Of a club near Brixton station
Rolled one line
Come and smoke my weed baby
Smoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups 
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what 
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey


I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do


But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up

Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved

Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm


I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you 
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you
]
And of the pieces of my soul

You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there 
Can I say goodbye to you 
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace 
Can I say goodbye to you  Ohh


I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out "
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect 
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you

My mind is a warrior, my heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the color of red like a sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up and left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart, not a follower, we're not done yet


And I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down

You're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down
Now you're strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down


My eyes are a river filler, this drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest again
Your body is my ballpoint pen and your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again


Now, I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
No, I'll never let you down
Now, keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down
I'll never let you down
My mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like the sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet
And i see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That ill never let you down
I'll never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down

My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
Your chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest
Again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That I'll never let you down
I'll l never let you down
NoneFell out of love with her
Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don t come round here
And chances are slim

But eventually
You ll be mine

Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim
But eventually
You ll be mine
I won t miss a thing
If you re mine

I don t care if you re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that

All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can t fix this

Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I d regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren t even listening
I might be too much right now man it s sickening
Can t believe I m running from her
I m stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she s never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can t tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her

Well the road is wide
Waters run on either side
And my shadow in the fading light
Is stretching out towards the night
When the sun is low
And I have so much more to go
And my lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder
There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
So I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
Till I find my way home

Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light


Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
This weeping tree no longer holds
Oh well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh, and I will keep on moving 'till
Until I find my way home


When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light

When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
I heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you 
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you 
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah

Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
He rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...
Walking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new

'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you 
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
 Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I ll be waiting here for you

She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know

That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we "
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know


But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we "
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
None
It's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart

It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on


So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold on
Could I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures 
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer  Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey


I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again

It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah


And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1

None
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you


We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but


How would you feel
If I told you I loved you 
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too


In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
I found the words to say how I feel
But I just can t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I m a different man with a different tune
I didn t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
 Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something close
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance " 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya 
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway 

'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm


We're at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what  It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that


Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay

I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance " 
I fucking love ya, did I ever tell ya 
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say
I always feel like I'm nobody
Who wants to fit in anyway

And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm


Look at you glowin' up the dance floor
There ain't nobody that can do it like that
The way your dress holds your frame
The way you know the words to every rap
Can't believe it's true
How I managed to get a woman like you 
I don't think I ever told ya
You make it better like that


Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody 
But now I think that we should stay

Ayy, I waited for you all day


I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"

There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over


 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time


I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home 
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone 
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't

I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet


Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you


How can I tell you 
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came

Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us


And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home


See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop
None
It s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that s left is shattered hearts
It s plain enough for us to see that
You ve got me
You ve got me


We re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It s no fuss
I m not in love

Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You ve got me
You ve got me


We re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It s no fuss
I m not in love


I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer s touch
It s true
I m glad I m not you
I'm in love with the coco 
I got it for the low, low, low, low


Hit my plug, that's my cholo
He got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco 
Hit you with that treinta ocho
If ya thinkin' that I m solo
A 50 deep, I m like,  oh, no 
I heard the feds takin' photos
Nothin , not the popo


I m in love with the coco 
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I m in love with the coco 
I got it for the low, low, low, low, low
I m in love, I-I m in love with the coco


30 flicks, that s a kilo
I need a brick, miss my three flow
I m in love, just like Nino-no-no
Bustin' shots like Ne-Yo
Free my homies, not the C.O
And not the judge, not my P.O. no
All this sugar, I m like Nino
Water whip, I m like Nemo

If you wanna put this on me, that s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won t work
So can you help me out 
Things we try to do won t work
So can you help me out 


And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it s true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new

See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all




Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy


I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
I write this song in memory of
The wayward smile, the boy we won t forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows the tears that we wept


Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone
And I know that you're gone

The cheeky smile of jokes and laughs
The memories of times we crossed the line
The stepping stones across my mind
Washed away, we all now feel so blind


Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you're gone 
And I know that you're gone 
And I know that you're gone 
And I know that you're gone 
I'm getting very edgy
'Cause you're trying to take this from me
And it s something that I wanted so bad
'Cause you're the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
'Cause you're a jealous girl, and all I can say is
It s your fault but partially mine 
For losing hope, for not treating you right
But that will disappear in time

All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong whenever I say "Why "


Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else 
I m losing sleep, I live only for the week


I've grown to ignore you
'Cause when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do 
But I don t care as long as you re mine
It s happening every time


All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what's wrong whenever I say "Why "

Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
If this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will

Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky

Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fire
Oh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons


If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side

And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me


Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky


Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me

I will remember you
In the way you'd want me to
But it's hard to come to terms right now
Sunset looked today
As if it knew you'd gone away
Now it's night, I hear the rain crash down


Oh, I'd cry, but this is more than just my pain
Oh, I could be a shoulder, not a burden
And it's time for me to call your son again
And say

She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away


I will remember you
With white wine by the barbecue
On New York at the birthday do, downtown
All that comes to mind
When I think about the time
Is a memory of laughin' out loud


Oh, I wish, that I could take the pain away
And just talk to him in person
But it's time for me to call your son again
And say


She was the starlight in darkness
She was the first bloom in spring
An angel with a smile like electric light
All the time, hit her wings
She was the birdsong in morning
But now everything here has changed
All the world's less beautiful
Since you've been away

I stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm


And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home


If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home

One, two, three, four


Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me, yeah
And hold me in your arms


And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now

Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love


Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh, no


My heart's against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with this feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now


Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
I went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet

And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out

Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here

Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within

And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight

This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here

Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now

I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here

Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without you
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close

5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed 
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by


I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

If I forget to say goodbye
Before I catch the plane
Would you know the way that I
Feel when I'm away 
We'll see the same sky tonight
But the stars are out of place
You'll never know the weight of my heart
Every time I leave you, babe


It's hard to break the landing
But I'll see you again

I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life


Oh, I could never tell you, "LY"
Or put in words your finest traits
The darkest green and hazel eyes
And yet, I can't describe the shade
You are all this heart of mine
And there you will remain
You'll never know the weight of my
Decisions when I leave your smiling face


It's hard to understand it
But I'll see you again


Oh, I, I'm never gonna leave your life
Even at the times I'm miles away, you are always on my mind
Forever and now, I will be by your side
I know it can change from day to day, but this love'll keep alight
I'm never gonna leave your life
I, I'm never gonna leave your life

I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now

I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now


I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours

I feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come I didn't even get a mention "
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception
Ah, no bars, get it 
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it 
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it 
I hit the ground so hard, headache
Ah, it's mad
I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad


I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December



Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them 
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton

I text her, "you dissed it". She don't reply like it's none of my business
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you do me so wicked  Something must've happened, how did I miss this 
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness 
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say "I got P"
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house

Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
You give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go


And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now

And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh


So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now


It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue


, baby, let's ride

Mmm, excuse me, , blame it on the juice and the Jager Bomb
Shot in my handLyrics from Live debut


It hit like a dream, I ran out of words
I got nothing to say, everything hurts
And I know love needs the pain
Memories serve our sweetest refrain


The waves came tumbling down
As you float away
Reaching for ya

So tell me how
How our life goes on with you gone
I suppose I sink like a stone
If you leave me now
All the stumps will roll
Easy come, hard go
Then life goes on


But I miss the things that needed reason
Oh, I remember the way that you've look d at me first
And all the heart that you chang d
But you'll never know just like tears in the rain
Mm, mm, mm


The constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name
I think of love


So tell me how
How our life goes on with you gone
I suppose I sink like a stone
If you leave me now
All the stumps will roll
Easy come, hard go
Then life goes on

If we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now 
Let me hold ya, oh


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walkout, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little homemade tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird


And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die


But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth 
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little birdIf we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now 
Let me hold ya, ohh

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird

If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me

But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon

And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird

My little bird

My little bird

My little bird

And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die

Listen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in

She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly


Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn

It's been a while since we been alone
To turn off the world and the telephone
I need to tell you you're beautiful
'Cause it's been a while and I apologize
I just get caught up in the rat race I'm runnin'
Chasin' a moment I'm hoping is comin'
If I stopped and took a look around
It's in front of my eyes, eyes


Baby, let's slow down time
Maybe just press rewind
Darlin', that dress reminds
Me of the first time

And I wanna love tonight
One on one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion


It's been a while since it was you and me
Too many friends, too many evening drinks
Yeah, we commit to so many things
But not to ourselves, and I apologize
Sometimes, you're sad and you tell me it's nothin'
And I brush it off because there's always somethin'
But I need to change my perspective
And prioritize-ize


'Cause one thing I know is this
Every moment missed
Can be restored with your lips
It only takes one kiss


And I wanna love tonight
One-on-one by the candlelight
Over and over, we spend our lives
Livin' fast forward but not tonight
Love in slow motion
Hi, I'm Ed Sheeran, in session here and this is my cover... kind of... of Justin Bieber's 'Love Yourself...



For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that

My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own


'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself


But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from


And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
Lyrics from Rolling Stone

This is how it feels to be in love, this is magical
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Make it rain

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same


Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Make it rain
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Make it rain


Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change
When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love

When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love

I know you haven t made your mind up yet
Though I could never do you wrong
I ve known it from the moment that we met
Deep down in my heart s where you belong
I d go hungry; I d go black and blue
And I d go crawling down the avenue
No, there is nothing that I wouldn t do
To make you feel my love

The winds are blowing on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain t seen nothing like me yet

I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
There is nothing that I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

I could be that someone if you want to
The city don't sleep much at night
Maria don't care 'cause that's a lie
Come ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks


You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly

Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain


You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud


And you ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins


Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behinds desks
I just want you to know that I can see through your masks
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You that play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly



Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But i see through your eyes
And i see trough your brain
Like i see through the water
that runs down my drain



You that fasten all the triggers
For the others to fight
And you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud
Lyrics from Snippet 1

My neck's still red, the sky's still blue, my truck's still big, my girl's still you
We live where we live because we love living in Middle AmericaNone
Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what 


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what 


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery


It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what 


I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery

Shock, horror, I m down, lost, you re not around
There s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me


I don t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you


These words mean nothing to me
I m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I m painting
And my belly s sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me


I don t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I ll let go as soon as you do
See I know we re not through

Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags


You didn't know me

You couldn't show me

My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags


You didn't know me

You couldn't show me

My one and only
Has gone away
Far away

You didn't know me

You couldn't show me

My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
Now it seems I ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there s only up, there ain t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold


What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now

Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it


When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top 
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up


Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it
None
I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters


She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border


From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya

I said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe 
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how


Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings


Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo 
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...
.
Nah nah nah nah nah


I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to M laga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya

Ooh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now


Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon 
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again

Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York


Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
'Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again

They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in

When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me


You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken 
Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm 
Gang signs I'm in LA reading 
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next 
They tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen 
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading
Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me

You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder 
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again

Oh, Nina
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now 
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now 


And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again
None
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough

No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark


Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away


No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah

I'm screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We'd flirt
And you'd treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse


And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again 
What can I do to be making you see 
To come out clean 
You're better off with me

We're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass


All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close 


And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again 
What can I do to be making you see 
To come out clean 
You're better off with me


We're stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glassNone
Born with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate


Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire 
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars 
Should I drop to my knees 
Scream your name out in vain 
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane 

King of the kings, do you feel any pain 


I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name


Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire 
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars 
Should I drop to my knees 
Scream your name out in vain 
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane 


King of the kings, do you feel any pain 
King of the kings, do you feel any pain 
King of the kings, do you feel any pain Lyrics from Live debut


If you and I keep doing this, yeah
Then nothing can break us
Trouble leaves in real pace
But we're sure we can take it


We take our Hell
And overthink it
What can get burned out

But this is no strings
You are who I love
And that won't change
When we're falling apart
Yeah, this is no strings
You are who I love
It's just growing pains


If we make it through this, yeah
We should celebrate it
Rarify atmosphere
Till now we evaded


We tore the walls down
To build them up
Never was in doubt


'Cause this is no strings
You are who I love
And that won't change
When we're falling apart
Yeah, this is no strings
You are who I love
It's just growing pains

I feel it, can you feel it tonight 
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn 
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my

I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you 
And you ain't got nothing on you 


Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no s  qu  pas , ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitaci n
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficci n cuando entramo' en acci n
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh 
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa 
Y s  lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar


I was rolling up something with you 
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
Think it's written on a notebook somewhere
Can you feel it as you breathe the night air, yeah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was hard, hard, hard for you to speak

Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood, yeaaah
Let's just continue what we used to do
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth

And it's late, it's late
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no

Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no

Drift off into space without care
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer, yeah
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth

Sleep tight and I will not wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love, heeey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth

And it's late, it's late, no

I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave


And would you take away my hopes and dreams 
And just stay with me, ooh


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one


Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through

It's such a beautiful night to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talkin' 'bout love and life
Oh, how lucky am I when I look in your eyes 
What a wonderful way to spend a moment or two
To be lyin' awake, and be here talkin' to you
I got somethin' to say, I know what I gotta do
To be makin' a change, now the moment of truth


Why am I feelin' so nervous when
Things are goin' so perfect  And
But I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you

And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you 
Will you marry me  Just say yes
One word, one love, one life


A gentle touch of the hand, fingers runnin' through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh, I was caught unaware
Arms holdin' me tight, tears in both of our eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of our lives
Sun will reappear, burnin' auburn and red
My chest was the pillow, green grass lawn was the bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
And what a wonderful way to fall in deeper in you


Why was I feelin' nervous when
Things were goin' so perfect  And
Well, now I know that it's worth it to
Spend forever with you


And so I count to three and get on one knee
And I ask you
Darlin', honestly
I've waited all this time just to make it right
So I'll ask you 
Will you marry me  Just say yes
One word, one love, one life

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams 
And just stay with me


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one

Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one


Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong


All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Lying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention, as she makes an entrance
Said I had a tendency to finish off her sentence 
Oh, well, she's a local girl
No make-up 'cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
Is it fast food  I'll regret it after
And I needed money but I'm too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she's all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She's still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man

I don't wanna go alone
I don't wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone


Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she's more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don't, I'll tell her myself
And we've got that love in us, so if the drink kill us
We're gonna dance all night 'til the floor feel us
If we talk outside, so you hate wasps, too 
I don't really dance, so I'll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight 
Tell me if that s alright, I don't wanna be here
I'm not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don't mind sharing
She said, "I wanna take off what you're wearing"
None
Can t get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I ll say what I don t mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you re the one to blame
You can t remember my name
We re lost, it s such a shame


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see

I m strong yet proud
I m quiet yet loud
And I m everything
You want in me
I m small yet tall
I have it all
And I m everything
You want me to be


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see


And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I m on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you still


Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Making me seeNone
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now

And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now


I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now



I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
To rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
Alone
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both

I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me


This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Leave us tainted
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us


The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
Alone
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both


I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me

Baby, you will never be lost on me

You know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I've been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you re spinning my track
That'll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I'm a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock with the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up, we won t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind

And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on


This is Alonestar coming at you with a new style
Kicking dust, ready to bust, it's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with  Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking, ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds, we're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see you ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar and Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump, drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound, let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll, can you feel me now with my body 
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place and Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up, I said rise up


And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
I met her smokin' a cigarette in a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest, she's beautiful
This  ain't the time or place to start a future, but, darlin', I don't care
Broken hearts can find a love to make them whole anywhere


Well, darlin', here we go again
We  are only man and woman and we all make mistakes
"Don't  you know we're only human ", is what I heard you say
And when I heard those words, I knew them, oh, I could feel your pain
'Cause  I have felt the same, no

Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh,  can you see the love in mine 


She told about her mum and dad and they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchangin' names, and two souls intertwined
And we have both got it wrong from time to time, but let that go
We lead each other hand in hand as we mend our broken souls


Well, darlin', here we go again
Oh, we are only blood and bones that cover beatin' hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones, but we know who we are
And I could put you back together when you come apart
And we should make a start now, oh


Oh, she said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly, but God knows we can try
And I see a hope that's in her eyes
Oh, can you see the love in mine 


And it feels like we found serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me

I found a love for me
Oh, darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
 Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I m dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"


Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
I shares his dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are just kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes


And, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight

I found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight
None
I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine

Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight


Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes


Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song


I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me closer 'til our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, well, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home

Loving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive


We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still

So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home


Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die


Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul


Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Face me, are you tired of living 
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I m so frustrated, so dilated
And she s telling me I ve wasted my time
And I m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we re asking for so much more
Now you re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor

Face me, are you tired of living 
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I m so frustrated, so dilated
And she s telling me I ve wasted my time
And I m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night

Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time,  cos I won t mind
I doubt if I even know that I m awake

And still you re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we re asking for so much more
Now you re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul


I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you 
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say


Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me


Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me

In shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams


Things aren't what they seem

Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better


Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don't even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all


Still, things aren't what they seem


Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I'll let you all see that I'm doing better
That I'm doing better

Hi, my name is JME
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
"JME just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different 
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'ma do this

I never had a playlist in my heart 
Now I need an A list just to chart 
But I've been famous from the start 
How am I gonna make my mark  Oh, oh


Are you gonna play me though 
This song was never meant for the radio
I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist
And how much will you pay me though
If this song was not a hit on the radio 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See, I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that  What's going on there 
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be

Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club

You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy



I can still remember  tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it , became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell  if I'd prevail 
And all I did was  put nine-inch nails 
In my eyelids now 
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit 
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said

I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go
"How long you leaving "
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go
Lyrics from Live debut


Is this so far to go 
And I can't feel my toes
When the rain soaks through the hills
And slips to the soul
Yeah, the blades are two feet tall
Awaiting green, I'm moving forward to where God only knows
Feel the winds harsh for frame
And the clouds grip my face
Saying it's alright to run from all this pain
Oh, when it's time to go
With one last breathe that's in my loins
I scream, "It's all for love"
I scream, "It's all for love"

Come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel it, three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep end, leave everything
It was just a dream


I can see it out the head
Where the sky, we stand ground
And after that there's only blue and gray
I am full up with regret
With things I did or never said, just leave that well alone


And, come kiss me, salt water
Oh, finally, I feel it, three or four degrees
I'm free in salt water
Embrace the deep end, leave everything
It was just a dream


Ah-ah
It was just a dream
Was it just a dream 
It was just a dream
Ah-ah
It was just a dream
Was it just a dream 

You were loved before you had arrived
And every day that love just multiplies
Daddy made your bed and your lullaby
And Mumma made the mobile in the sky
And loving you is easy
But life will not always be
Fall into the world of your song
Whatever you feel could never be wrong


Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes

And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll b  warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my lov 
Hangin' out with the Sandman


Chocolate-covered roof and candy cars
Rainbow sugar river we can sail upon
Marshmallow books and strawberries
Snowmen made of ice cream
Over the flower fields, we'll fly
We'll count the fish in the sky
Honeybees and birds sing your song
Whatever you feel can never be wrong


Come along for the ride
And in the shake of a lamb's tail, we'll go
Yeah, be still now and close your eyes


And dream
Hangin' out with the Sandman
You look so sweet, my child
Hangin' out with the Sandman
Although there's rain outside, you'll be warm and dry
The thunder and the lightning won't hurt you now
So go to sleep, my love
Hangin' out with the Sandman

Sara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind


Hey now  Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I m in a mood
So I thought I d write a song for you


And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
 Cos you are great, I thought I d say that


Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don t look good when you do
Even with that soul


Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I m in a mood
So I thought I d write a song for you
On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me 
Oh, honestly 
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself

I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain


Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself

Just keepin' it honest
You wouldn't want a young man if I wasn't whippin' this foreign
That's why I came back, top down


You gon have to do more than just 
You gon have to do less when you

And I'm not looking for just an affair
Wanna love that is based on truth not just dare
Come and let me get down on it, yeah
Love it when you spin round on it, yeah
Even though you know that I just want you

And when I come down on it, yeah

To let you know you know the things I'm down for
Ain't goin' act like you ain't bout

Streamin' out, the foreign out to play

And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car whippin' out
And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car let it go
You've got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this


Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars

You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been traveling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you like petrol
You find so much beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high, that's why


Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, color the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars


I can take away your scars
I can take away your scars
You're what I wanted
You were the one thing I
Keep running back to, back to in my mind
I wanna be there
I wanna go tonight, back to the garden hidden in my mind


So who's to say that I'm not seeking sympathy
I'll find my way back home to the

Secret garden
To the secret garden
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden


Remember the night that you and I were laid beneath the poster-covered sky 
You thought my bed-side light was morning


So who's to say that I'm not seeking sympathy
I'll find my way back home to the


Secret garden
To the secret garden
You are the place that I run to
Nobody knows but me and you
That secret garden


And oh-oh, you're so beautiful
And when I close my eyes I'm right by your side in the

A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with your body


Baby, yo s  lo que quieres
Y yo vine a darte placere'
Eres la m s linda, la que mis ojos quieren
La que mi cuerpo prefiere
Dame, dame de eso, mamacita
Yo quiero m s de ti
Dame de tu cuerpo que me excita
Dejaste mi cama oliendo a ti

Major Lazer for the ladies
Ed Sheeran and Kranium
You know your body look good
So good, so good, yeah


The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like

Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Hey, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mmm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you 


So good, so good, yeah

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like


Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
None
Hey
This is the remix
Ed Sheeran, Mohombi


Girl, you must be a dancing queen
Moving that thing like nothing I've seen
You're like the woman in my dreams
That won't let a man ruin your self-esteem
You say you're way too shy to show
Fine, so let's keep this one on the low
I say we chit-chat, then we tiptoe
Out of here, what you say 
'Cause I'm ready to go

Ask me what I want to do
It's so simple, all I want to do is you
I really don't mean to be rude
But it's the truth, girl, all I want to do is you
Can't say I drank too much
'Cause I got sober every single time we touch
I love how you act so tough
Ain't too hard to tell you lik  it rough


I'm in love with the shape of you
W  push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body


Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I

Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you 


I gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for 
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for 
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check

I paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I d never leave her
But now I m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She s endless to me
She s just like paperwork
But harder to read


Patience's my enemy
And loving s my friend
It s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself

I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way


Patience's my enemy
And loving s my friend
It s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself


And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won t you stay " She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey


Simmer down, simmer down
They say we re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don t swim, you ll drown
But don t move, honey

You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey


Let s get out, let s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too 
'Cause all I really want is you


You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of  94
I ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey

I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You ll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon, you ll be floating away


And I ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I m captain of the sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home

When salted tears won t dry
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes, your eyes


I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend


And I ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I m captain of the sinking boat now
With just one armband to carry me home


When salted tears won t dry
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all

Baby,  
                   
                                 

I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like


I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like


Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back

Slip, trip, fell in love like you cast a spell
Wonder if you're a witch or you'd know you're the only one I think of
When the drink starts flowing, well we know what's involved and we disengage
Well if this is fate then we shouldn't drift apart
Or let it slip away 'til death do us part
Through sickness and in health
I cannot go a day without picturing your face 
And the way you kiss me lips
I flutter like the first time 
I'll always come back to you
You're the only one I've chased
But I've made mistakes that could j opardise everything
I'm t rrified to lose you

You've picked me off the floor
When I am steaming drunk 
You are the oxygen
Inside these aching lungs
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love


It's the light shade of everything of what you're asking
'Cause it's a crying shame
If we miss it when it's right under our nose
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love


You kiss me on my lips
I kiss you on your mouth
It shouldn't feel like this
But it just fucking does
Show me the way to fall in love
Show me the way to fall in love


I tell you hold my hand
And darling don't be scared
You might not understand
But I'll always be there
Show me the way to fall in love, yeah
Show me the way to fall in love

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady

I need you, darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won t you let me know 
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
Oh-oh, ooh-ooh

This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep **** if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth

It's late in the evening
Glass on the side

J' tais   l'aff t d s que je l'ai vu dans le fumoir
Elle m'a dit :   Tu me plais, j'ai peur de te blesser, fuis moi  
C' tait comme un frisson qui m'sortait d'un puits sombre
Une impulsion puissante de mon intuition
Ton c ur est bris , laisse-moi r parer tout  a
La souffrance   tes c t s me para t douce
Elle m'a dit :   C'est de la parlotte, ch ri  
Oui, mais on est s duits l'un par l'autre, ch rie
Allez, montre-moi...
Je ne vais pas m' tendre, non
Allons se d tendre, elle m'a
Demand  que je l' trangle tendrement
Alors on c de aux vices sans trop discuter
Elle le sait d'office grosses cuisses pour m'exciter
J'ai mis en sc ne les pr misses de cette promiscuit 
On s'est rien promis, on s'aime pour mieux s'quitter

Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth

Come on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines

Come on skinny love, what happened here 
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split


And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I 
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines


Who will love you 
Who will fight 
Who will fall far behind None
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life


And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right


Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes


And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right

Now, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer
But I feel like playing it today
Let's see how it goes


You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life

And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you


'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright


Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes


I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you

Just give me a pen and I ll write my worries
Now and again I ll try and not see that you don t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don t care


And hey, I don t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile

They ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture 
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don t care


I'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother


I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know

I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss


'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...


Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm


I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh


I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know

She's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high

We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you


When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day


And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high


We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you re married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy 
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn t stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah

You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days

I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn t stay away, I couldn t fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you d be reminded that for me it isn't over, yet

Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead" Yeah

Lyrics from Live debut


We've been lost for a long time
And there are no escape signs
And for love, we were so bling
Oh, I hate to see you cry
As we turn to a true light
Now it's clear as a blue sky


Like a man they overdid, the past will try
We couldn't the fate to send me on the night

We'll build a fire
Touch our own life
And hope the spark survives
'Cause we're just living
Around the night sky
With the memories to the light
Hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives


Oh, I wonder what we go through
All we ever do is argue
We never love but we make do
How I wish you wouldn't say that
And there are things you can't take back
When you leave I always will expect


Like a hand, I'm trying to hold the water back
And softly the oceans leans in the cracks


We'll build a fire
Touch our own life
And hope the spark survives
'Cause we're just living
Around the night sky
With the memories to the light
And hope the spark survives
Yeah, we hope the spark survives

Take me with you, I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share 
What can I do to make you care 


The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark
The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark







We d be together through bad or worse 
Sending letters we shall converse 
We could do better but we must first 
Make amends that depends 
Will you be my friend 


The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark
The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark
The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark
The world is harsh
I'm stuck in the dark
I'll make my mark
I've got my spark

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till


You know just what to say, some things that scare me
I should just walk away, but I can t move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Oh, oh

Hey
I didn t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don t need butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you


By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn t know that I was starving till I tasted


You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah
I was so much younger yesterday


Hey
I didn t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don t need butterflies when you bring me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body
I didn t know that I was starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Starving till I tasted you

Stevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I m gone


Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you re winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song

Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breatheNone
Another human cloud to bring you down when you blew the last away
And bring out a poisoned tongue or plastic crown, but for me, they look the same
Sometimes, it can get all too much for me
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy


Don't let the ones who hurt you see you cry
Tomorrow is another day


You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel

You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


Another "I, me, mine" to blur the lines between love and then heartbreak
Oh, it's a lonely life thinkin' you're right and always shiftin' blame
And every time it's gettin' more and more ugly
And that's why the photograph gets burned, throw the match in gasoline, a-ayy


Don't let them tell you "keep it all inside"
I know the winds have got to change


You cannot stop the rain, no way
Holdin' an umbrella when the grey clouds come over again
Tryna find somethin' real, but it's not the game they play
Pretendin' that the weather is in your mind, you got no one to blame
But that's just the way I feel


You cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Cannot stop the rain, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah


And it seems like time
Can be so much more than a wake-up call, and live real life
Every day is a chance that we can start over, read my mind
There'll be ups and downs, but it won't change a thing between you and I
There's one thing I can't change
Lyrics from Snippet 1

Saturday night is giving me a reason to rely on a strobe light
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely


Another night, another club
Another room, a new one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
But I'm lonely, in LA


No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah


Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark
None
You re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren t clear

When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I d miss you
And I miss you


She was mine
I was hers and all that s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be


I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren t clear


We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I d miss you
And I miss you
You're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine

I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her

I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you

She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be

If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh

We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you

I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved

So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Lyrics from Live debut


Sycamore in the summer, buried in leaves
Swing and pushing our daughter underneath
Flowers building the garden, spring breeze
Just imagine the world were we could be


Right now in the waiting room, emotions running wild
Worried 'bout my lover and I'm worried 'bout a child
Part of me was always in denial
It's gonna take a little while

But in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious
We're in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious


Sycamore and the shivering b ating sun
Nothing more than a loaded smoking gun
What a pleasant is this, to b  in love
To be plating the weeds and dig them up


Waiting on professionals to tell you how it is
What's he gonna say after, "I think you better sit"
Places and something's are about to hit
It's gonna take a little while


But in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious
We're in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious
We're in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious
We're in our story, loving, lover
We are glorious

I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax  I'll take it back now

Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No


I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism

Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London
I do deals, but I never get twanged 
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
No goons that were never in gangs 
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone

It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for  
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now


Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London

Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London

So take me back to  Birmingham, 0121, stand up!

My lover's got humor
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's getting more bleak
A fresh poison each week
"We were born sick"
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me "Worship in the bedroom"
The only Heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick, but I love it
Command me to be well

Aaa, Amen, Amen, Amen


Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Good God, let me give you my life


If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine looking high horse
What you got in the stable 
We've a lot of starving faithful
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work

Mmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend 
And do you know I will treat you like him 
And I know


You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me

Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know


You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me




You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo

You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need

I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see 
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love

White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us

White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men


And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream

And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
The angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we ll fade out tonight
We don t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It s too cold outside
For angels to fly

Angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we ll fade out tonight
We don t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It s too cold outside
For angels to fly
And they say
They scream
They see
Slowly sinking, wasting
And they say

Slowly sinking, wasting

An angel will die
Closed eye

Hello, everyone! Yay, we're so near the time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks  So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!

This city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home 
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps, then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
And the shop across the road
Fills my needs and gives me company when I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow


London calls me a stranger, a traveller

It will take me where I need to go

This is not what I m used to

When I need it

Look its funny how the city where the Queen sleeps
Still ain t got clean streets
But there ain t a day when she ain t got clean sheets
Homeless people roam with needles and
You ve got to pay tax to afford a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs are a no go area
Man are like  Pass me your mobile, here me now 
And with the crunch of the credit
You can t get a roof over your head
You re stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don t play they
Dive and snatch things and it don t say that
Now equipped fear  cause a victim of inflation
The black letters turned red and they been patient
And now six years rent has just been wasted


I m from a city where the rain won t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won t erase me
But I can t help to see how this dark city changed me
It s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me



Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the city
Hey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
And homeless people roll with needles
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area
The man are like "pass me your mobile, hear me now"
And chew the crunch on the credit
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted

London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I m blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two


And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive 
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along


Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses

Lyrics from live performance


Oh, leaves are covered in snow
And the water's frozen
Oh, I long for you to be the one that I'm holding
And warm me down to my bones
As you lay beside me, hold me close
Oh, leaves are starting to fall
And the sun goes cold
And my heart might break from the way of it all
For all that I know
You could be holding someone, yes, it's cold

So when I'm home
I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know
I have never told you
Darling, we fall in lov  with the hills of Aberfeldy


Oh, th  ground is slowly mounting
And the sun beats strong
And I feel like my feet may have wondered too long
And I will remain here alone
'Cause I fear that you may have found someone


So when I'm home
I'll hold you like I'm supposed to
Yet I know
I have never told you
Darling, we fall in love with the hills of Aberfeldy
Darling, we fall in love with the hills of Aberfeldy
How was I to know  It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be 
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen




And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would giv  you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the b st in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
How was I to know  It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be 
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen

I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen




And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen
How was I to know  It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be 
The road that was broken brought us together


And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen


I've been played before, if you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff 
And saw through all my tells 
And then you went all in
And we left together
And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold, a palace, and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in m 
The joker and the queen

Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But **** it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot 
I think not

I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
Anymore
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Anymore


Recently, I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with

Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now, I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all


Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all

A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And, perhaps, be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you all
Pass me a drink
You say it's gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile


You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile
You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette
You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea

I've taken the blow
It's all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no "see you later "


You're wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don't reach
Your smile
You're holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You're eating your fears
In a cigarette
You've waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
I keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away


Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there

I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there's a pub
It s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they ll return again

I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog

Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
Yeah, well the summer time is coming
As her warm breath starts to blow
She will for the spring like she's a domino
By his sides, she begins to glow
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks 


And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks 
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three


When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are


I'm thinking out loud


We found love right where we are
We found love right where we areWhen your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love 
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks 

And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
Baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Now, I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same

'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it is evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory

I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
None
This is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, oh


And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall now

You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing


And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall now, woah


And take me back, take me home
Watch me fall down to Earth
Take me back for


This is the start of something beautiful
You are the start of something newThis year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last
Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt get thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last
I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with m 

Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lif , life is changin' tides
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way


Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, "Princess and the face scar"
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tidesNone
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh


Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said

So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke


Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go


It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it


If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke
NoneNone1738

I'm like "hey, what's up, hello"
Seen yo pretty ass soon as you came in that door
I just wanna chill, got a sack for us to roll
Married to the money, introduced her to my stove
Showed her how to whip it, now she remixin' for low
She my trap queen, let her hit the bando
We be countin' up, watch how far them bands go
We just set a goal, talkin' matchin' Lambos
Got 56 a gram, prob' a 100 grams though
Man, I swear I love her how she work the damn pole
Hit the strip club, we be letting bands go
Everybody hating, we just call them fans though
In love with the money, I ain't never letting go
And I get high with my baby

And I can ride with my baby

And I get high with my baby
I just left the mall, I'm getting fly with my baby, yeah
And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby, yeah

I hit the strip with my trap queen 'cause all we know is bands
I just might snatch up a 'Rari and buy my boo a 'Lamb
I might just snatch her necklace, drop a couple on a ring
She ain't want it for nothin' because I got her everything
Bitch you up in the bando, without deniro can't go
Remi boys got extendo, count up hella bands tho

And I can ride with my baby
I be in the kitchen cooking pies with my baby, yeah
Sing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I d wager that you re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said  You and your big cheeks have got me 
Along with  Disarm  and  Flooded Quarry 
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain t wrong
He s got me singing to  Amerikan Folk Song 
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain t no fake, it s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout  Wow! 
How did they even have the guts to do it  
If your name s Nizlopi, then there ain t much to it
 Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around now
Strings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy


Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean


Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me 


Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean

I'm made of clay, you shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Your words of paint, they draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words

I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time


This grief you give, it takes its toll
And it dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned to stones, oh


I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last time


Ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah, ah-ah-ah-ah

I found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not

So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out 
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied


Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything s great, not everything s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in a position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss, it was perfect
We were nervous on the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss

Rain keeps meeting on our rooftop, mind the glass
But god, I love the sound of Hell
Sad crumps spreading on the carpet
Listening to a vinyl, trying to ignore the web


This week was heavy, I buckle on the road
What can you do but pray 
And count your blessings, there wasn't any other way
Don't leave it all to faith

Follow the tide by the waves
They all part
Love the night we run in
To be stars
But it burns like Hell
To be Vega


Clouds keep falling over this house
Blocking out the sun, I'm tryna keep it all together
One door closes then one opens
Gotta keep the focus, if we believe then she'll get better


The days are long but then they pass and then an instance breaks
It is the strangest thing
I count my blessings, the day I see you smile again
It's what we've got to win


Keeping inside, don't ever want
See your heart
No one can judge, we're the same
In the dark
Follow the tide by the waves
They all part
Love the night we run in
To be stars
But it burns like Hell
To be Vega

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's getting older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you


Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights 
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away

I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation 
I hadn't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do  'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear 
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turning out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away


I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own


And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been awayNone
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again and just replace it
See, I could do without a tan on my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath and fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
And maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray in the winter
I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder

And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me 
Could you make me a cup of tea to open my eyes in the right way 
And I know you love Shrek, 'cause we've watched it 12 times
But maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale, too
And if your DVD breaks today, you should've got a VCR
'Cause I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you'd laugh at me, and be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you'd lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up

On the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, "Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called "Wake Me Up"
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind


I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder


And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up


And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say

I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets

I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go


And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah 
Hey ay ay yeah 
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah


And I know dark clouds, will gather me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields that lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep


And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now

Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He's slowly finding a way back home


He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
'Cause he's one dog who don't want a bone
He's slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife "What's mine is yours"
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He's slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He's slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he'd found that she'd overgrown
This man who's finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man's June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He's slowly finding a way back home

Well I once heard a story 'bout a run-down home
Where a man with regrets lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He'll never find his way back home
Star sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin  'bout her


And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love

Oh, why, oh why am I alone 
Did I, did I do something wrong 
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else 
So tell me, girl


How can I live without love 
How can I be what you want 
 Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark 
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms 
Well, that's the way to break my


Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That s the way to break my 


First love never dies
Guess I ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember

Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh


Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry
Oh oh
I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes
Oh oh


And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone


Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh, Oh oh
Oh oh
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heart beat in my mind

It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go


We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive

We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Welcome to the world
I heard your heart beat and lost every word
Just stood there quietly taking in the sound
Of our love
This is gonna hurt
But I'll stand beside you, for better or for worse
And I will find you whenever you're lost
I'll be right here


And ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

Welcome to the world
Through all the pain, you're a diamond in the dirt
Don't let them change you, words are only words
Just like I loved you
And yes, you were the first
Brought a new beginning, bright and unreserved
A beautiful red flower in the earth
Will grow, and I know


Ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away


Welcome to the world
Welcome to the world
Oh, welcome to the world 
Welcome to the world 


Ooh, I know that everything's changin'
Ooh, and I don't wanna miss a thing
Ooh, I know that life won't ever be the same
And this love won't ever go away

Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity

We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know 
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know 
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade


I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity
None
Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I m next to you
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you  Do I hate you 
I can t make up my mind
So let s free fall and see where we land

It s been this way since we were young
We ll fight and then make up
I ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch


Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you  Do I hate you 
I can t make up my mind
So let s free fall and see where we land


Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da


Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you  Do I hate you 
I can t make up my mind
So let s free fall and see where we landI stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself 
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are

Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are

Brushing my hair
Do I look perfect 

I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try
The less it's working
Yeah
When everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah

Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
NoneSo, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail 
A smile from a veil 
Do you think you can tell 
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts 
Hot ashes for trees 
Hot air for a cool breeze 
Cold comfort for change 
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage 
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found 
The same old fears
Wish you were hereToday is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...

Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now

And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...

I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...NoneOld yeller!!!
I felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it s the worst thing that I did

When I read through you
You weren t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I d be free from it


See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it s the worst thing that I did


The thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute  Can I be me for a minute 
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love 
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone

And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you


I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan"
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at night


Well my friend it seems we ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you
 Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left

The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you re too cold
And she said  I can put away all those lies
And show you there s no surprise in me 


Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left


Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that s what s going on

Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now

See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

And I write my own verse  Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell 
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe

And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"

I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend

Cause you need me, man, I don t need you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you
You, you, you, you, you, you, you, you, you


Cause you need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you at all
You need me, man, I don t need you


Cause you need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
Cause you need me, man, I don t need you

I still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this

You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you at all
X2
You need me
I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisq  plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it



Right now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
Bringing the hot flows skipping across
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing
Man think we need them but onna that thing
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people

'Cause you need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you at all
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you
You need me, man, I don t need you at all
You need me


Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than  when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I 

Well I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I m a bad influence, that ll do
 Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don t be slow
This ll only take a mo 
Take yourself right out of my door

It s just that they don t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl s trouble


Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
 Cos you re a bad influence, that ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don t be slow
This ll only take a mo 
Take yourself right out of my door
