
I was woken by a bang
And I could already taste the shame
The sudden fear that grips and shakes you
When you face the truth

Whose sofa was this 
Where were my shoes 
What did we do last night 
I don't remember leaving Nathan's house

Ah yeah, how could I forget
Why my pants were soaking wet
When we'd been pissing ourselves laughing at the news
Did you see it too 
It was incredible, they played it on a loop

Basically, they'd discovered, that there were others just like us
Other beings, and other creatures, and other planets, and other species
Who had other gods that they believed in
And they interviewed all of them everyone of them it's true
None of them had a single clue what they were doing here either


It's all so pointless
It is, l find it humbling, sincerely
And when you're gone
It brings me peace of mind to know that this will all just carry on
With someone else 
With something new 
No need to be blue
Oh it's great to see our homeland
Breathe the Iberian atmosphere
Just because we are Hispanic
Doesn't mean we're oceanic
Quite frankly we've had water up to here

We've made waves to last a lifetime
We've been saturated, almost drowned
We are Spanish not Caribbean
We are human, not amphibian
We'll seek our fortunes on Spain's solid ground

There's no future in the new world
Only fools believe the tales
Of the gold of El Dorado
Only suckers set their sails
We have seen the way the tide is turning
We see what no sailor can
We are in the ball, discerning
We're antediluvian
Two very fine examples of
Sixteenth century man
Two terra firma samples of
Sixteenth, sixteenth century man

There are women who are lining
Every avenue in every port
Now at last we'll get to grips with
Things they never equip ships with
We have sailed into our last resort

I cheated just to get on by
Yea, I cheated just to get on by
If I can't save my sinnin' whys
Gonna keep on getting high

I'm sleeping off the weekend drunk
Sleeping off the weekend drunk
When I'm awake I'm looking back
On all the ships I've sunk


Two fingers of whiskey
Good ol' fashioned rye
Wish I was bound for glory
And prohibition dry
Two fingers of whiskey
That is all I need
To keep drowning the devil
Living in me
Living in me


I'm hanging on the hook of the moon
Hanging on that treble moon
If I don't get out of this battle
Lord, you're gonna see me soon

Hold up y'all, hold up
Not yet Elton, hold up
Let the beat ride for one second
Now...
Go 'head John
Go 'head John
I like that
Yeah
Hmm
Let's move it out, let's move it out
Break it down like this


Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Uh-huh  uh-huh
 Yeah, yeah

Let's move it out like this 
Bring it in

I heard that  come on and play that back 
I'm really feelin that  c'mon let's smash the track

Break it down for me 
Slow it up
Yeah
Uh-huh
C'mon Elton, break it down
Elton, what, huh 
OHHH!
Yeah
None
One by one, they followed the sun
One by one, until there were none
Two by two, to their lovers they flew
Two by two, into the foggy dew
Three by three, they danced on the sea
Four by four, they danced on the shore
Five by five, they tried to survive
Six by six, they were playing with tricks


How many paths did they try and fail 
How many of their brothers and sisters lingered in jail 
How much poison did they inhale 
How many black cats crossed their trail 


Seven by seven, they headed for heaven
Eight by eight, they got to the gate
Nine by nine, they drank the wine
Ten by ten, they drank it again


How many tomorrows have they given away 
How many compared to yesterday 
How many more without any reward 
How many more can they afford 
I stumbled down 5th Avenue
In the winter time, 1982
No heavy coat, thin pair of shoes
In the rush hour crowd, on 5th Avenue

I thought I saw someone I knew
Turned out to be no one but you
Something borrowed, something blue
Ducked in a doorway on 5th Avenue

Chorus:
All my crimes come back to haunt me
Every building seems to judge
Standing tall and looking down
Like fingers pointing from above
On 5th Avenue, on 5th Avenue
The party's over on 5th Avenue
Fortune finds the chosen few
Fools just find someone like you
Build a bank, or you buy a zoo
Monkeys and money on 5th Avenue

Snow falls on 5th Avenue
Your old man is on the evening news
Hard to believe how far he flew
Down, all the way down to 5th Avenue





Yeahhh, it s fuckin Satan bitch
I m a fuckin demon from fuckin Hell
I ve come to take the fuckin gays, and the fuckin queers, and the fuckin league players



Yeah bitch you re gonna fuckin die
I m gonna fuckin kill you in the fuckin eye
My name is Satan, Lucifer, Lucy
I ll take any *laughs*


I m the fuckin leader of the fuckin cult bitch
You re gonna fuckin smell my god damn fart bitch
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It s fuckin Satan!Music by elton john
Never released

NoneAbide with me, fast forth the eventide
The darkness deepens, Lord abide with me
When other helpers fail and comforts flee
Help of the helpless, O abide with me
I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless
Ills have no weight and tears no bitterness
Where is death's sting, where, grave, that victory
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me
Hold Thou, thy cross, before my closen eyes
Shine through the gloom and point me to the skies
Heaven's, morning breaks, and earth's, vain shadows flee
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me
In life, in death, O Lord abide with me

Uma carta 


A minha resposta
T  um pouco amassada

This isn't no battle honey, this isn't no fight
How come you take it so hard when I stay out all night
If I take a drink, is that against the law
And if I have a good time, do you call that an act of war
Well you better believe it boy, this house is your home
I didn't build it up for you to live here on my own
And if you think it's easy to forget about me
You'd better think twice, you'd better believe it's an act of war


We're living on the front line you and me
Fighting on this battleground of misery
Oh go ahead bring on your artillery
And we'll make this an act of war


Give it all you've got because I'm all dug in
Keep the punches coming I can take them on the chin
Winner takes all, let the best man win
And we call it an act of war
Well I'm a man of convenience I work a long hard day
After twelve long hours haven't I got the right to play
If living together is getting in the way
Then I call that an act of war
See my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

If you're quick enough to rise
With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
I know that only you can help me now
Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind

But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
Worrying is a sin

If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

Purple rains have turn to gold
The clouds of yesterday
And a dandelion dies in the wind

I see my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears

Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind
See my eyes and I see my arms
The seagulls say you've gone
It was just a game of let's pretend
And I whistle to the waves that lend me tears


Purple clouds, golden rain
Yesterday has gone
And a dandelion dies in the wind


If you're quick enough to rise
With the sleep still in your eyes
You'll see the shadow of the sun above my mind
For the sea of tears is drowning me
I cannot feel, I cannot see
I cannot feel, I cannot see
I know that only you can help me now


Purple clouds, golden rain
Yest rday has gone
And a dandelion dies in th  wind


But a dandelion sighs
And it tries to tell the wind
That crying's not a bad thing
But worrying is a sin
If they sent a cloud from heaven
I would ride into the skies
To escape all of my troubles
And to cast away your lies

I can hear your heart
Pounding in my ear
Now I feel the sound
And the time is near
I feel the taste
Of all the things you do
Now the time has come
I know you're a dream come true
You make me so complete
With the things you do
And the music's sweet
You make me feel brand new
I hear the sound
Songs start coming through
Somehow I know
That you're a dream come true

It takes my breath
When it sounds that way
Seems like you
Chase the clouds away
And I feel so good
Each and every day
And life is good
Each and every way


Now I feel the beat
Of the dancing drums
And now I know we're
Going to have some fun
Now the time stands still
And the blues are through
And now I know
What I'm going to do




I lie awake and realize
That you're better than my dreams
Thought I found love so many times
'Til you showed me what it means


Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh, no, baby
They were just doin' it wrong
I gave up on love until you made me believe in it after all
After all, mmm


If you never fell out of the sky
I don't know what I would do
I wouldn't trade one thousand lives
For the one I have with you
Oh, oh, nothing compares to you
Oh, no, baby
They were just doin' it wrong
I gave up on love until you mad  me believ  in it after all
After all, oh, ah

Claudia was nothing to you, why, Armand 


For this moment...
For this beautiful moment


What taste is this upon my lips 
A taste so sweet, what can it be 
What is this scent upon the air
That fills my lungs and comforts me

And whispers low
How does it feel
To savor up such just revenge
TO smell the fragrant sea of loss
And drunkenly inhale his pain

Oh, can it be your countenance
Is stripped of all its dash and dare 
And what of your bold confidence-
Could it have drowned in your despair 

And after all this time
I wash my hands of your charade
And celebrate your fall from grace
Preserve that sad look on your face

Don't shy away from coming in
Closer still my darling friend
Don't slip, don't trip on life
I bear the moon
Inside your eyes
Don't be afraid of all my years
What you see or what you hear
It's all yours and yours and yours alone
Yours for the taking, so take it home

Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you


Oh sure it's cracked a time or two
But him and me, we pulled on through
I've seen 'em come, I've seen 'em go
Some went through fast
Some went real slow
So take a chance, and take your time
Reading my face between the lines
I love real good, and I love you
My heart and me
That's what we do


Oh it's a good heart
To be a part of
Just a soul full all men tend to love
The kind of love you never knew
Oh it's a good heart from me to you
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing

I got your picture hanging on my wall
But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame

I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear
I play my games of fantasy
I pretend I don't see reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me

I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of you being there

No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together

I'm so
So glad we got the real thing, baby
So glad we got the real thing
Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby
Ain't nothing like the real thing
Isn't nothing like the real thing, baby
Isn't nothing like the real thing


I got your picture hanging on my wall
But it can't seem to come to me
When I call your name
I realized it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters but you're not here
They don't move me, they don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice whispering in my ear




I play my games of fantasy
I pretend I don't see reality
I need the shelter of your arms to comfort me


I got some memories to look back on
Though they help me when you're gone
I'm well aware
Nothing can take the place of you being there
No other sound is quite the same as your name
No touch can do half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together
None
The sister of sunlight
Comes to my lonely life
Bearing the crosses I hung
I hung on my lonely wife
And the anchor told me
If I prayed by the river
That the sweet sound of water
Would always go with her


All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chains

Then the mother of mercy
Showed me her stable
And told me you would be safe
Safe in her cradle
And the waterfall opened
And the water withdrew
Leaving me standing
On a road leading through


All across the havens to the waterfall
They told me that I would meet her there
Inside those icy walls
But how on earth in this universe
Can they forgive me of my pains
For all across the havens
I must stumble locked in chainsNone
All, all in the name of being somebody



You can tell me anything, something wrong or right
Just pick me up and get me out of here, while I've still got an appetite
Tell me something funny, so good I want to hear it twice
Just fill me up with rhythm and a beat, and take me into the night
Cause I don't get to sleep these days

Even when I do behave

No cigarettes but in my own little way
I push to the limit of the night and day

And all, all in the name of being somebody
That somebody cares about
All, all in the name of being somebody
That somebody cares about


Seems we don't know anything about walking in a straight line
Weave and weave through all these streets, till choice has left us almost blind
To how we used to make decisions with instinct and with time
Now if I blink I miss the only second I get to catch another's eye


So I don't go to sleep these days
Cause no one's got the time to waste
We call it being young and say
That it's fun when we really wanna walk away


But it's all, all in the name of being somebody
That somebody cares about
All, all in the name of being somebody
That somebody cares about


All, all in the name
(All in the name, all in the name
All in the name, all in the name)
All, all in the name
(All in the name, all in the name
All in the name, all in the name)

All of the lights
Lights, lights
All of the lights

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need, want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights

Fast cars, shooting stars
All of the lights, all of the lights
Until it's Vegas everywhere we are 
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
If you want it, you can get it for the rest of your life
Somethin' wrong, I hold my head
MJ gone, our nigga dead
I slapped my girl, she called the feds
I did that time and spent that bread
I'm heading home, I'm almost there
I'm on my way, heading up the stairs
To my surprise, a nigga replacing me
I had to take him to that ghetto university
None
Lights, all of the lights


Lights on, I see your face
She eat me up, she got expensive taste
I see you dreaming, but you still awake
Big slices, that's how you cut the cake
It's cold as hell, I show and tell
Weezy home, our nigga out of jail!
In this "give-or-take" world, I got what it takes
Put you out your misery: Kathy Bates
I'm Young Money, I'm Cash Money
If we could buy time, I'd spend my last money
Now I'm spending time, you in the blind
This little light of mine, I'ma let it shine
Bright lights, night lights, headlights, shh!
No lights but them infrared lights
Long knife, don't like to ask twice
You killing me baby, this the past life

Turn up the lights in here, baby
Extra bright, I want y'all to see this
Turn up the lights in here, baby
You know what I need
Want you to see everything
Want you to see all of the lights


Ready, set, go, go, go, go, go
Go 'til you can't go no more
I'm ill times ill, dope plus dope
"Westside bitch," quote, unquote
Whoa there, boy, don't go there, ho
If you cross that line, I might overload
I swear these lights-lights-lights be talking to me
But I can't read Morse Code
Why every rapper named "Big" got bodied, huh 
But every rapper named "Sean" got money  Ooh
Well, I guess my chances are fifty-fifty
But my vision is 20/20, so I be counting a hundred hundreds
Like, oh, my Allah, Lordy Lordy Lordy
I took your chick, now you want beef, and I'm just chuckling like I'm Porky
'Cause you spent all day with her spooning
I spent all night with her forking
There's a one-way ticket to Hell and they want these bullets to book it for me, man
I'm shitting on every statistic that said I'd be dead or fuckin' broke
This is history, your kids' kids' kids' kids' kids gon' book report me, what 
And I think they want to murder me
I'm shining hard , 'cause, bitch, I'm an emergency

All quiet on the Western Front, nobody saw
A youth asleep in the foreign soil, planted by the war
Feel the pulse of human blood pouring forth
See the stems of Europe bend under force


All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front


So tired of this garden's grief, nobody cares
Old kin kiss the small white cross, their only souvenir
See the Prussian offense fly, weren't we grand
To place the feel of cold sharp steel in their hands


All quiet
All quiet
All quiet on the Western Front


It's gone all quiet on the Western Front, male angels sigh
Ghosts float in a flooded trench as Germany dies
Fever reaps the flowers of France, fair-haired boys
String the harps to Victory's voice, joyous noise

Breaking down never seems to be that hard
Falling short is always in the cards
I'm on the road, sunrise is at my back
Lost it all somewhere between the cracks
I always hoped that I'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we deliver
Then there are the lucky ones


And I've got all that I'm allowed
It'll do for me, I'm thankful now
The walls get higher every day
The barriers get in the way
But I see hope in every cloud
And I'm thankful, thankful
I'm thankful, so thankful
I'm thankful, I've got all that I'm allowed


Leaving town gets to feel just like a job
My desire never winds up on top
I can say now I didn't want the moon
It's out of reach somewhere beyond this room
I always hoped that i'd do better
That I'd come out on top for once
We all get what we're delivered
Then there are the lucky ones

Raised to be a lady by the golden rule
Alice was the spawn of a public school
With a double barrel name in the back of her brain
And a simple case of "Mummy doesn't love me" blues


Reality it seems was just a dream
She couldn't get it on with the boys on the scene
But what do you expect from a chick who's just sixteen 
And hey, hey, hey , you know what I mean

All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me 
Wait till my husband's away


Poor little darling with a chip out of her heart
It's like acting in a movie when you got the wrong part
Getting your kicks in another girl's bed
And it was only last Tuesday, oh, they found you in the subway dead


And who could you call your friends down in SoHo 
One or two middle-aged dykes in a go-go
But what do you expect from a sixteen year old yo-yo 
And hey, hey, hey , oh, don t you know 


All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they say
Come over and see me
Come over and please me
Alice, it's my turn today
All the young girls love Alice
Tender young Alice, they'd say
If I give you my number
Will you promise to call me 
Wait till my husband's away
If it came to pass
That they should ask
What could I tell them 
Would they criticize
Behind my back
Maybe I should let them


Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man

If they could face it
I could take it
In their eyes
Oh, I know I'd make it
Their tiny minds
And sacred cows, just fake it


Oh, if only then and only then
They would understand
They'd turn a full-blooded city boy
Into a full-blooded city man


But I know the way
They want me
In the way they publicize
If they could turn
Their focus off
To the image in their eyes
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
Maybe it would help them
Help them understand
That a full-blooded city boy
Is now a full-blooded city man
NoneYou know it, it is only true
That you could be the best of you
How I wonder miles away
Tying horshoes by the bay

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Many say and lucky do
My own fire once said it too
Leave the ocean live and play
Door on sockets yesterday

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Is it fair or nestled sorrow
You could be there tomorrow

As we know, maybe faster
All the way down to El Paso

Whooo ...

Whooo ...

Oh in a little while from now
If I'm not feeling any less sour
I promise myself
To treat myself
And visit a nearby tower
And climbing to the top
Will throw myself off
In an effort to
Make it clear to whoever
What it's like when you're shattered
Left standing in the lurch
At a church where people saying
 My god that's tough
She's stood him up
No point in us remaining
We may as well go home 
As I did on my own
Alone again naturally


To think that only yesterday
I was cheerful
Bright and gay
Looking forward to--
Well who wouldn't do 
The role I was about to play
But as if to knock me down
Reality came around
And without so much
As a mere touch
Cut me into little pieces
Leaving me to doubt
Talk about god in his mercy
Who if He really does exist
Why did he desert me
In my hour of need 
I truly am indeed
Alone again naturally

I will always love you
Even when I say I don't
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known
I will always love you
I will always love you
I will always love you
Even if you let me go

Cryin' about somebody, tell her
Somebody come pass an umbrella
Fucked this bitch inside the 'tella
I had to take the call, past the tele'
I bought you Gucci, baby, Mais' Margiela
You can get a new one, but he won't be better
Straight to the top and don't need no propeller
Oh, I've been all outside with the fellas
Take me back, I can put you in control if you take me back
Goodfella, roll in a new Maybach
She been fuckin' me good and I'm hooked like crack
Make sure you ballin', don't worry 'bout nothin'
You keep on goin' forward and never look back
You bring me luck just like 7-Eleven
And just for that, I'ma give you some racks, let you splurge
Mama, what's the word 
All I do is flirt, just do it like a verb
Takin' off your skirt, this the night I make you squirt
Pull up to the tele', watch me murk you with no dirt
Bet you never leave


I will always love you
Even when I say I don't 
I will always see you
Even when my eyes are closed
Uncertain of a lot of things
But with you, I've always known 
I will always love you 
I will always love you 
I will always love you 
Even if you let me go



Mhm, hmm, hmm; mhm, hmm, hmm
Ooh yeah, mmm, mhm, yeah
Mhm, hmm, hmm


Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen


See the little baby
Wrapped in a manger
On Christmas Morning

See him in the Temple
Talking with the Elders
Tomorrow there's wisdom


Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen


Down at the Jordan
And John was baptizing
And saving all sinners

See him at the Seaside
Talking with the fisherman
And making disciples



Amen, Amen
Amen, Amen, Amen
Amen , Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen

Amen , Amen 
Amen, Amen, Amen 




Seen him playing in his backyard
Young boy just starting out
So much history in this landscape
So much confusion, so much doubt
Been there drinking on that front porch
Angry kids, mean and dumb
Looks like a painting, that blue skyline
God hates fags where we come from


'Western skies' don't make it right
'Home of the brave' don't make no sense
I've seen a scarecrow wrapped in wire
Left to die on a high ridge fence
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold, cold wind
It's a cold wind blowing, Wyoming


See two coyotes run down a deer
Hate what we don't understand
You pioneers give us your children
But it's your blood that stains their hands
Somewhere that road forks up ahead
To ignorance and innocence
Three lives drift on different winds
Two lives ruined, one life spent
N o h  muito que eu n o dividi
Com  voc , por onde andei
E  o amanh  vai existir
Eu soube e ainda sei

De repente vejo aqui
Um  caminho que eu n o vi
Pra  onde pode me levar 
N o me cabe perguntar

Quem  est  certo  Quem errou 
Quem partiu ou quem ficou 
Todo o rio segue o leito
  o destino  eu aceito

Amigos  nunca dizem adeus
Nunca dizem adeus
Nunca dizem adeusI'm sorry for everything I've said
And for anything I forgot to say too
When things get so complicated
I stumble, at best, muddle through

I wish that our lives could be simple
I don't want the world, only you
I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time, never the place

So this letter will have to do
I love you
Lately, I've been thinking
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield
Brightening the daybreak


Living like a lusty flower
Running through the grass for hours
Rolling through the hay, oh
Like a puppy, child


And when it rains, the rain falls down
Washing out the cattle town
And she's far away somewhere
In her eiderdown
And she dreams of crystal streams
Of days gone by when we would lean
Laughing, fit to burst upon each other


I can see you sitting, eating
Apples in the evening
The fruit juice, flowing slowly, slowly, slowly
Down the bronze of your body

Lately, I've been thinkin'
How much I miss my lady
Amoreena's in a cornfield

Livin' like a lusty flower
Runnin' through the grass for hours

And she dreams of crystal streams

Oh, if only I could nestle
In the cradle of your cabin
My arm's around your shoulder, oh
The window wide and open
While the swallow and the sycamore, whoa
Are playin' in the valley
Oh, I miss you, Amoreena
Like the king bee misses honey
NoneUne nuit je m'endors avec lui
Mais je sais qu'on nous l'interdit
Et je sens la fivre qui me mord
Sans que j'aie l'ombre d'un remords
Et l'aurore m'apporte le sommeil
Je ne veux pas qu'arrive le soleil
Quand je prends sa tte entre mes mains
Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin
Strands of light upon a bedroom floor
Change the night through an open door
I'm awake but this not my home
For the first time I'm not alone
Reaching out I touch another skin
Breathing out as he is breathing in
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame
Can my love ever be the same 
Et je me demande
Si cet amour aura un lendemain
Quand je suis loin de lui
Quand je suis loin de lui
Je n'ai plus vraiment toute ma tte
Et je ne suis plus d'ici
Oh! Je ne suis plus d'ici
Je ressens la pluie d'une autre plante
I should have told him
I'd do anything if I could hold him
For just another day, for just another day
His love is something I will not forget
When I am far away, when I am far away
I feel the rainfall of another planet
Another planet

Quand il me serre tout contre lui
Quand je sens que j'entre dans sa vie
Je prie pour que le destin m'en sorte
Je prie pour que le diable m'emporte
Et l'angoisse me montre son visage
Elle me force parler son langage
Mais quand je prends sa tte entre mes mains
Je vous jure que j'ai du chagrin
Close together in the afterglow
I remember how his loving flow
Turned the key
Tread on my face if you like, little lady
Turn me inside out if you have to, baby
But don't you cross me off your list
Ooh, I am young and I ain't never been kissed
Never been kissed by a lady called Amy


You're far out, you're fab and insane
A woman of the world, it's quite plain
My dad told me Amy's your name
Said he'd break my neck if I played your game
But he can bust my head 'cause I, I love you all the same


Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy




Amy, I know you don't have to show your affection
'Cause the big boys like you and to you, I'm an infection
So if you don't want me around
I think I'll run along and drown
You can't want this bum in town, Amy
NoneNoneI came down here just to waste some time
To get a little rest and to ease my mind
I didn't calculate it when I walked in the door
I only thought I'd stay for a minute or more

First I saw the lights on the ceiling dim
The stale perfume yeah, and the beer canteens
My first impression was to get outside
But then I saw you crying, crying by the fireside

The pendulum swings
Going to and fro
And the clock goes round
Says it's time to go
And the clock goes round
And the hours fly past
Slow down pendulum you're moving much too fast
Now it's gone kind of quiet but I seem to see
That the only people here in the room are you and me
But I don't mind girl, girl that's all right
As long as you're gonna be with me, gonna be with me all nightNone
The sun is up and the shades are all pulled down
I'm more paranoid with every little sound
Like the leaf blower blowing the leaves around
And a siren wailing on the other side of town
Oh the tvs on and the colors really hurt my head
If I could think straight I'd wish I was dead
Or curled up naked in my lover's bed
Instead I'm hanging over hell suspended by a single thread


And I don't recall who said it at this time
That your enemies grow strong on what you leave behind
I built it up and the wolf he came around
He huffed and puffed and the house fell down


With a rolled up note I'm hovering on that line
Three days on a diet of cocaine and wine
And a little weed just to level me sometime
I put the clock in the drawer because I've cancelled out the time




So don't knock on my door, don't try to call
I'm holed up in this room talking to the wall
When you're high as this you think you know it all
When you're this deep in there's no place else to fall

The angel tree has grown so high
And its roots are planted deep
Never climb that willow
'Cause its trunk is awful steep
Yeah the trunk is awful steep

Seven miles south of the city
Way on a windy hill
The whistling branches of the angel tree
Are calm at the evening still

Magical    
As the leaves are    
And strange things happen to people
Who go on to the windy hill

    down here
Had gone up to there
And rested underneath her bough
They slept long, what is wrong
They never woke up againNoneNoneThis year, next year, sometime, never
Will we ever get together
I keep hoping things are gonna change
Colours changing red to yellow
Yesterday you said hello
And from now on I'll never be the same

Annabella Umberella
Standing on the corner when the rain comes down
That's the way I'll always think of you
When I first met you
Annabella Umberella, child
I wanna get to know you better
Get to know your name
And yet I know to me you'll always be the same

Sunshine sunshine go away
Come again another day
Raindrops fall, us both together
How I love the rainy weatherSad to say our mighty ruler
Is not really in the pink
Hopes could not be minuscular
That he'll come back from the brink
Not to beat around the bush
He looks like heading for his box
At the risk of seeming pushy
We must plan for future shocks

According to the hawk of horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid

Build it, build it
Another pyramid
Build it, build it

Though all doctors and physicians
Have been summoned to his bed
It'll soon be top morticians
We'll be calling for instead
With each wheeze the nation's humming
Egypt shakes with every cough
No two ways about what's coming
No discussion, bets are off

While you've been away cavorting
Matters here have moved apace
Now I need you home supporting
All the plans I've put in place

First of all this means your wedding
You'll recall your future bride
For the way that Pharaoh's heading
Time's no longer on our side

According to the hawk god, Horus
Our most regal invalid
Is not that much longer for us
Build another pyramid!

There are many who'll be tearful
As our leader fades away
But our architects are cheerful
And each dog must have its day

If our country is to flourish
Then my son must take the lead
Be our inspiration, nourish
All our hopes our dreams our creed

Well, they say that it's a fact
If you watch the sky at night
And if you stare into the darkness
You might see celestial light
And if your heart is empty
And there's no hope inside
There's a chance you'll find
An answer in the sky
Well, they say that it's a shame
If you have nothing to believe
And if you can't hold on to something
You might as well die where you sleep
You don't need a prayer
And there's no price to ask why
Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky

And it's all so much bigger than it seems
And it all overwhelms us now and then
And I'm banking on a chance that we believe
That good can still control the hearts of men


Sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky




This life's a long old road
We shouldn't have to walk alone
But if you find the right companion
You won't feel so worn out when you've grown


All life is precious
And every day's a prize
And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the sky


And sometimes you'll find
An answer in the skyAnyone who ever loved
Could look at me
And know that I love you
Anyone who ever dreamed
Could look at me
And know I dream of you
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
What am I to do
Every time you go away
I always say it's goodbye dear
Loving you the way I do
I take you back
Without you, I'd die dear
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You, you couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you've hurt me
And be so untrue
So what can I do
Knowing I love you so
Anyone who had a heart
Would take me in her arms
And love me too
You couldn't really have a heart
And hurt me
Like you hurt me
And be so untrue
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me in her arms
And, and always love me, and love me, love me
Why won't you
Anyone who had a heart
Would love me too
Anyone who had a heart
Would surely take me
Anyone would take me
Why, why won't you
No one's gonna love ya like I do
No one's gonna make you feel the way I do
Yeah
No one
No one, no one, no one, no one
Catch a star if you can
Wish for somethin' special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself
Think of someone listenin'
One melody, you're all for me


I'll write a symphony just for you and me
If you let me love you
I'll paint a masterpiece just for you to see
If you let me love you, let me love you

Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love 



You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there
Lovin' you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so


We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops
To the valley below us
We'll serenade the world with a lullaby
So the angels will know us, angels will know us


Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Love




Catch a star if you can
Wish for somethin' special
Let it be me, my love is free
Sing a song to yourself

Are you ready, are you ready for love 
Yes I am, are you
Are you ready, are you ready for love 



You're the one like the sun
Shine your love around me
You'll always be the one for me
Say the word, I'll be there
Lovin' you forever
Don't let me go, just say it's so


We'll hear the music ring from the mountaintops

None
It's so strange he doesn't show me
More affection that he needs
Almost formal, too respectful
Never takes romantic leads
There are times when I imagine
I'm not always on his mind
He's not thinking what I'm thinking
Always half a step behind
Always half a step behind
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh


I'm in every kind of trouble
Can't you tell  Just look at me
Half ecstatic, half dejected
All in all I'm all at sea
Easy terms I thought I wanted
Fill me now with chilling dread
You could never know the chaos
Of a life turned on its head

Oh, oh, oh, oh

I am certain that I love him
But a love can be misplaced
Have I compromised my people 
In my passion and my haste 
I could be his life companion
Anywhere but where we are
Am I leader  Am I traitor 
Did I take a step too far 
Did I take a step too far

Lily pulled a horseshoe from a pile of junk
Said "I'm going to keep this good luck
Piece of iron inside my truck"
The boy just whispered "OK"
And grabbed his old black dog
As we piled on in and cut out through
That late November fog
Dull as a plough share rusting in the yard
Old Cotton grinned and waved goodbye
While the auctioneers all played cards
On every other Sunday
I'd walk down to Moe's and back
Eat a t-bone steak, watch a picture show
For a dollar and a half


Come on little sister get up off my knee
Going to settle down someday
In a town called Jubilee
Come on brother Jake
Break on out and a break free
Going to set things right and set up a house
In a town called Jubilee


That fog came out of nowhere
Short of what I can tell
Hand to hand we passed that bucket
Up and down from the well
"Gone to California"
Used to be what folks would say
Down around these parts if it was me
I'd have hoped that westbound stage
Uno zaino per terra, in tenuta da guerra, tu fai l autostop
Sei talmente carina che la mia frenata si spiega da s 
Mi sorridi e in un lampo ti sistemi al mio fianco
Dicendomi:  Senta, con me si va in bianco, faccio l autostop
Non l amore... io non fumo 

Io non fumo   il tuo modo di dire: "Rifiuto la corte da te"
Io che stavo impazzendo, ti dico scherzando:  Ma ce l hai con me  
Da che parte vuoi andare  Sia pure all inferno
Su me puoi contare, andata e ritorno
A giocare un po  mi diverto anch io... ma poi fumo
Io sto qua, al posto mio
Vado in bianco fino a sera poi ti sistemo io
Io sto qua, non dico "ah"
Ora ti conosco appena e rischierei...

Anche tu dopo un po  sei crollata,   dura con me
Una macchina ferma e sull erba bagnata ci siamo io e te
Ci vestiamo in un lampo, non salire al mio fianco
Ti devo lasciare, sono un po  stanco
Vai con l autostop, io ritorno gi ... che fumata...

Ci vestiamo in un lampo, non salire al mio fianco

Io sto qua, non dico "ah"
Ora ti conosco appena e rischierei...
Io sto qua al posto mio
Vado in bianco fino a sera poi ti sistemo io...Where have you been are you still on my side
Is that love or regret that I see in your eyes
How many years have we played out this game
Every time we come close the answer's always the same

I guess some souls get restless under the skin
There's a shortage by half of marrying men
You know that I love you but I love to be free
So tell me what do you want, yeah from a gypsy like me

I need a ring on my finger, champagne on ice
One man to show me the best part of life
Is that what you want
Yeah, that's what I need
A home and a family makes sense for us
A solid foundation built out of trust
Do you think you can find that with someone like me
Two arms to hold you, one place to be
Are just some of the things that a woman needs

I've been shortchanged and cheated so many times
But you're all that I've wanted For all of my life
I've searched for the reasons, known how I've felt
But what can I give you when I can't trust myself
Where have you been are you still on my side

But what can I give you when I can't trust myself

I don't know why
I just know I do
I just can't explain
In this language that I use
Something leaves me speechless
Each time that you approach
Each time you glide right through me
As if I was a ghost


If I only could tell you
If you only would listen
I've got a line or two to use on you
I've got a romance we could christen


And there's a word in Spanish I don't understand
But I heard it in a film one time spoken by the leading man
He said it with devotion, he sounded so sincere
And the words he spoke in Spanish brought the female lead to tears
A word in Spanish, a word in Spanish


If you can't comprehend
Read it in my eyes
If you don't understand it's love
In a thin disguise
And what it takes to move you
Each time that you resist
Is more than just a pretty face
To prove that I exist
NoneFlew in from Miami Beach BOAC
Didn't get to bed last night
On the way the paper bag was on my knee
Man I had a dreadful flight
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Been away so long I hardly knew the place
Gee it's good to be back home
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case
Honey disconnect the phone
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boy
Back in the U.S.S.R

Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out
They leave the West behind
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout
That Georgia's always on my mind

I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.R

Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south
Take me to your daddy's farm
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out
Come and keep your comrade warm
I'm back in the U.S.S.R
You don't know how lucky you are boys
Back in the U.S.S.RIt's been a bad day child
On the side of sorrow
Oooh it's hard
You can't always be so fine
You know a kind of reason
Still you try to bring it down
Wishful dreamers tell me
How can you say that you're lonely
Only children cry

Wait for tomorrow
To come and may she greet you
Through the darkness of the night
It ends up changing

It's been a bad day child
Pray for the day
But anytime you need some love
I'll try try to understand
How can you say you need some company
Only children cry
You're the teacher
Tell me the story
Be a lovely lullaby

Wait for tomorrow to come
May she greet you
The darkness of the night
Gentle changes
It's been a bad day child
Pray for the day
But anytime you need some love
I'll try try to understand
I'll try try to understand
I'll try try to understand
Seems as though I ve lived my life on the bad side of the moon
Just stir your dregs and sitting still, without a rustic spoon
Now come on people live with me, where the light has never shown
And the harlots flock like hummingbirds, speaking in a foreign tongue


This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life
This is my life, this is my life, this is my life, my life


Seems as though I ve lived my life on the bad side of the moon
Just stir your dregs and sitting still, without a rustic spoon
Now come on people live with me, where the light has never shown
And the harlots flock like hummingbirds, speaking in a foreign tongue
I m a light world away, from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon




There ain t no need for watchdogs here, to justify or ways
We lived our lives in manacles, the main cause of our stay
And exiled here from other worlds, my sentence comes to soon
Why should I be made to pay on the bad side of the moon 
I m a light world away, from the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

It seems as though I've lived my life
On the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs in sickness still
Without the rustic spoon
Common people live with me
Where the light has never shone
And the hermits flock like a hummingbirds
To speak in a foreign tongue


I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon
I'm a light world away
From the people who make me stay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon


Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life
Who is my life, who is my life, who is my life


There isn't no need for watchdogs here
To justify our ways
We live our life in manacles
The main cause of our stay
Exiled here from other worlds
My sentence comes too soon
Why should I be made to pay
Sitting on the bad side of the moon

Seems as though I've lived my life on the bad side of the moon
To stir your dregs, and sitting still, without a rustic spoon
Now come on people, live with me, where the light has never shone

I pulled out my Stage Coach Times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew
The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And I hung my head in shame


Now they've found me
At last, they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well, I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun


Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord, I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast
The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

I'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Going to miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant

And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore


Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen




They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen

I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
You were the one to blame for tearing my world apart
I got a heart so true, you got a heart of ice
A little more love from you, it could have been paradise


I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart
And if it's all the same maybe we should part
And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do

You had to tie me down inside a cage of doubt
I'm sick of being kicked around so this is where I get out




Oh oui baby you tried to hold me but you were slowly
Driving me insane
Oh oui baby




I couldn't take your pain, you couldn't take my love
So I'm going to quit this game `cause baby I've had enough



I got a ball and chain hanging around my heart


And I'm singing do do do
I'm singing do do do
Well you're dirty and sweet
Clad in black don't look back and I love you
You're dirty and sweet, oh yeah
Well you're slim and you're weak
You've got the teeth of the hydra upon you
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on


Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're built like a car, oh yeah
Well you're an untamed youth
That's the truth with your cloak full of eagles
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl


Get it on, bang a gong, get it on
Get it on, bang a gong, get it on


Well you're windy and wild
You've got the blues in your shoes and your stockings
You're windy and wild, oh yeah
Well you're built like a car
You've got a hubcap diamond star halo
You're dirty sweet and you're my girl

There was a time when I was feeling incomplete
Lost in the shadow of the person I could be
Chasing perfection in every direction, so focused on the end
I didn't see the journey and take in every step


Every long road
Song that I half-wrote
Brought me to where I am


Every root turns into branches
Every question leads to answers
Even if the seed ain t fully grown
There's beauty in the bones
Just a drop can start a riptide
Just a word can change a whole life
Even if this story ain't been wrote
There s beauty in the bones


In the bones
In the bones
In the bones
In the bones
In the bones
In the bones
In the bones

Deep inside
My soul fights a war
I can't explain
I can't cross over any more
All I see are dirty faces
Rain and wire
And common sense in pieces
But I try to see through Irish eyes
Belfast

Look outside
Summer's lost and gone
It's a long walk
On a street of right and wrong
In every inch of sadness
Rocks and tanks
Go hand in hand with madness
But I never saw a braver place
Belfast


And it's sad when they sing
And hollow ears listen
Of smoking black roses
On the streets of Belfast
And so say your lovers
From under the flowers
Every foot of this world
Needs an inch of Belfast


Who's to say
On whom heaven smiles
Our different ways
We try hard to recognise
No more enchanted evenings
The pubs are closed
And all the ghosts are leaving
But you'll never let them shut you down
Belfast

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, costs nothin' to touch
War makes money, cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father, and that means somethin' to me


Churches and dictators, politics and papers
Everything crumbles sooner or later


But love
I believe in love

I believe in love, it's all we got
Love has no boundaries, no borders to cross
Love is simple, hate breeds
Those who think difference is the child of disease


Father and son make love and guns
Families together kill someone


Without love
I believe in love




Without love, I wouldn't believe
In anythin' that lives and breathes
Without love, I'd have no anger
I wouldn't believe in the right to stand here


Without love, I wouldn't believe
I couldn't believe in you and I wouldn't believe in me

I believe in love
It s all we ve got
Love has no boundaries
Got nothing to touch
War makes money
Cancer sleeps
Curled up in my father
And that means something to me
Churches and dictators
Politics and papers
Everything crumbles
Sooner or later
But love


I believe in love
I believe in love


I believe in love
It s all we ve got
Love has no boundaries
No borders to cross
Fathers and sons
Make love and guns
Families together
Kill someone
Without love

I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential
If allied to my vision and brain


I know that your powers of retention
Are as wet as a warthog's backside
But thick as you are pay attention!
My words are a matter of pride

It's clear from your vacant expressions
The lights are not all on upstairs
But we're talking kings and successions
Even you can't be caught unawares!


So prepare for the chance of a lifetim 
Be prepared for s nsational news
A shining new era
Is tiptoeing nearer
And where do we feature 
Just listen to teacher

I know it sounds sordid
But you'll be rewarded
When at last I am given my dues
And injustice deliciously squared
Be prepared!


It's great that we'll soon be connected
With a king who'll be all-time adored
Of course, quid pro quo, you're expected
To take certain duties on board
The future is littered with prizes
And though I'm the main addressee
The point that I must emphasize is
You won't get a sniff without me!

I never thought hyenas essential
They're crude and unspeakably plain
But maybe they've a glimmer of potential

Yeah, be prepared! Haha! We'll be prepared! For what 


For the death of the king!

Mufasa has always shown too much restraint when it comes to hunting. When I am king, the mighty will be free to take whatever they want, because a hyena's belly is never full.
Mufasa's far too powerful to challenge


Mufasa is yesterday's message
A clapped-out, distracted regime
Whose failings undoubtedly presage
The need for a different dream
Yes, leonine times are a-changin'
Which means that hyenas must too
My vision is clear and wide-ranging
And even encompasses you

So prepare for the coup of the century
Prepare for the murkiest scam
Meticulous planning, tenacity spanning
Decades of denial is simply why I'll be king
Undisputed, respected, saluted
And seen for the wonder I am
Yes, my teeth and ambitions are bared
Be prepared




Be prepared, be prepared

Be prepared


Be prepared

Yes, our teeth and ambitions are bared
Be preparedL
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go



Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Please, come take my hand
Girl, you'll be a woman soon
Soon, you'll meet a man



It was a clear black night, a clear white moon
Warren G was on the streets tryin' to consume
Some skirts for the eve so I can get some phones
Rollin' in my ride, chillin' all alone

Just hit the east side of the LBC
On a mission tryin' to find Mr. Warren G
Seen a car full of girls, ain't no need to tweak
All you skirts know what's up with 213


Lobotomy
Lobotomy
Lobotomy

There was a face on a hoarding that someone had drawn on
And just enough time for the night to pass by without warning
Away in the distance there's a blue flashing light
Someone's in trouble somewhere tonight
As the flickering neon stands ready to fuse
The wind blows away all of yesterday's news


Well, they've locked up their daughters
And they battened the hatches
They always could find us but they never could catch us
Through the grease-streaked windows of an all-night cafe
We watched the arrested get taken away
And that cigarette haze has ecology beat
As the whores and the drunks filed in from the street


'Cause the steam's in the boiler, the coal's in the fire
If you ask how I am then I'll just say "inspired"
If the thorn of a rose is the thorn in your side
Then you're better off dead if you haven't yet died


Ooh 
Ooh
Ooh 
Ooh 

Where's your hand when I need your touch 
To fold my fingers around and holding your love
Was there a place we tripped and fell 
Where we lost something we thought we knew so well
Golden days, they always favoured us
We'd laugh and say the days weren't long enough
The stars above were never out of reach
With you the ground was so secure beneath my feet


Everywhere I look and everything I see
I see a little bit of us and a lot of you with me
It's plain and simple clearly that things go so much better
With you and me a while and we're doing things together


Where's your arm to protect us both 
To slip around my shoulder when I need you most
I never felt the slightest doubt
Love builds a strong foundation when you talk things out
Love your smile, your sparkling eyes
Your laugh could drive away a cloudy sky
I reminisce on every little thing
As my memories make plans to see us with  again

I wonder who's sleeping in your sheets tonight
Whose head rests upon the bed
Could it be a close friend I knew so well
Who seems to be so close to you instead 
Close to you instead


I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty, oh and you were seventeen

So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay


And if I shower around 3 a.m. 
It's just to wash away
The trace of a love unwanted
Oh, in the times I went astray
The times I went astray


So out of choice I chose rock and roll
But it pushed me to the limit everyday
It turned me into a gypsy, kept me away from home
From there on, there seemed no use for you
For you to stay




I'm blue tonight, I'm red when I'm mad
I'm green when I'm jealous, yellow when I'm sad
I guess I cannot have everything
So much has flown between the years
When I was twenty, ooh and you were seventeen

Now I saw you talking to a cute little slip of a sailor
And it looked at first like the whole thing would end as a failure
He had a thing about a quarter to four
And he just couldn't handle any more
He's got his own big dipper so he won't be needing your big dipper
He's got his own big dipper and he won't be needing yours


So you filled him up with all kinds of stuff to relax him
And you took him down to the fairground after some action
And by around about a quarter to six
You found a different way to get your kicks
Up on the real big dipper where you tried a few new tricks
Big dipper
Up on a great big dipper did you learn a few new licks


He hadn't been too keen at the start
Now he seems to have a change of heart
He's got his own big dipper
Only now he's not so sure, big dipper
He's got his own big dipper
But there's always room for more


Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper
Everybody's got a song to sing
Everybody's got to do their thing, big dipper, big dipper

Oh, I've been staying up nights
Thinking 'bout a long flight that could take me home
Or a slow train rolling
Or a big boat floating out there on that lonely ocean
I'm not the man I was
I guess the dark side lost and the sun broke through
I thought I knew it all
I was the next big thing until I thought about you


Oh, I was reaching for the stars
When I wasn't even touching you
I was lying to myself, I needed no one's help
Thought I was living proof


When there's one set of footsteps
No one's gonna fill your shoes
Now I'm looking in the mirror
At a big man in a little suit
I'm a big man in a little suit
It's tight on me, hard on you
It's a short cut but it's a long way home
When you think you can make it on your own
You think you're bulletproof
But what you really are
Is a big man in a little suit

Nothing looks as bad
After staying up all night
And the cruel words that cut you down
I never meant to write
And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go


Clever lies keep coming
Some men never change
I'm a hand that's raised in anger
The blow that causes pain
But I just can't be trusted
With a bottle and a child
Billy it's no wonder
You say I've never tried

Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodby 
To Billy and the kids
Oh so leave m  now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids




And what came out as anger
Oh was a lack of self control
Billy won't you hold me
Once before you go


Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids
Oh so leave me now
Oh don't turn around
It's the best thing you ever did
But it's hard for me to say goodbye
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids
To Billy and the kids

Take the wheel I hear the timbers creaking
Take the wheel I think this ship is sinking
Jamaica seems so far and I've been thinking
Old billy bones has gone to sea and quit his dockside drinking


Check It out, check it out, check it out


And when I'm dead who'll fly the white bird home
I'm not the ancient mariner your children know
And the sea's the field these old jack tars have sown
Because billy bones just wants to know who'll fly the white bird home



Oh your majesty, your majesty
I heard the bosun cry
Old billy bones has washed ashore
Upon a foreign tide

 x2




Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
Check It out, check it out, check it out
There's some things I don't have now
Some things I don't talk about
These things are between myself and I
In my thick skull the joker hides
There's consequences I'm scared to taste
Cold hard truths I can't face
These days are different than the past
Reflections change in the looking glass
And everywhere I look there's something to learn
A sliver of truth from every bridge we burn
A hatful of quarters and a naked song
Don't answer the question of where we belong

How come birds
Don't fall from the sky when they die 
How come birds
Always look for a quiet place to hide
These words
Can't explain what I feel inside 
Like birds I need a quiet place to hide


These independent moves I make
This confidence I try to fake
You can hear the beating of my heart
But not a feather falling in the dark
And everything I hear never makes any sense
Another old prophet perched on the fence
A cupful of pencils and a self help guru
Don't answer the question of what I am to you


She slid down to the city limits
Monkey time in fifteen minutes
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance
Don't let me down
Ooh, please stick around
Bite your lip, get up, get up and dance


Strobe light on the funky feet
Soul children in the disco heat
Top dog, top cat
Move that muscle and shake that fat
Bite your lip, ooh, get up, get up and dance

Dance
I'm going on the circuit
I'm doing all the clubs
And I really need a song, boys
To stir those workers up
And get their wives to sing it with me
Just like in the pubs
When I worked the good old pubs in Stepney
Oh, could you knock a line or two
Together for a friend 
Sentimental, tear-inducing
With a happy end
And we need a tune to open
Our season at Southend
Can you help us 

It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das 
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars


I like the warm blue flame
The hazy heat it brings
It loosens up the muscles
And forces you to sing
You know it's just another hit and run
From the tin pan alley twins
And there's a chance that one day
You might write a standard, lads
So churn them out quick and fast
And we'll still pat your backs
'Cause we need what we can get
To launch another dozen acts
Are you working 
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das 
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars
It's hard to write a song with bitter fingers
So much to prove, so few to tell you why
Those old die-hards in Denmark Street start laughing
At the keyboard player's hollow haunted eyes
It seems to me a change is really needed
I'm sick of tra-la-las and la-de-das 
No more long days hacking hunks of garbage
Bitter fingers never swung on swinging stars, swinging stars

I don't wanna feel no more
It's easier to keep fallin'
Imitations are pale
Emptiness all tomorrows, haunted by your ghost


Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you


Fading out by design
Consciously avoiding changes
Curtain's drawn, now it's done
Silencing all tomorrows, forcing a goodbye

Lay down, black gives way to blue
Lay down, I'll remember you
Oh, your black icy stare
Once cut down, my friend
Oh, your black icy stare
Once cut down, my friend
Har ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon




Har ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon
Har ring molassis abounding
Kool kar kyrie kay salmon


Oh, your black icy stare
Once cut down, my friend
Oh, your black icy stare
Once cut down, my friend
Hey you, you're a child in my head
You haven't walked yet
Your first words have yet to be said
But I swear you'll be blessed
I know you're still just a dream
Your eyes might be green
Or the bluest that I've ever seen
Anyway you'll be blessed


And you, you'll be blessed
You'll have the best
I promise you that
I'll pick a star from the sky
Pull your name from a hat
I promise you that, promise you that, promise you that
You'll be blessed


I need you before I'm too old
To have and to hold
To walk with you and watch you grow
And know that you're blessed


I gotta quit this habit
It's like some drug for you
You've been my sweet, sweet addict
I've been your little white boy blue
You've got the same obsession
We ain't no cat and mouse
You linger on my lips like confession
You laid the traps in this house


And it's no use, each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run, hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck, babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue

Two hearts get entangled
Dirty minds, they go to town
Everyone's got an angle
Little lies get spread around
Let them say what they want
You and me, we already knew
Takes more than hocus pocus, babe
To save you from Blue Avenue


And it's no use, each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run, hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck, baby
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue
Blue Avenue




And it's no use, each way we lose
You and me at the crossroads of Blue Avenue
Hit and run, hearts collide here
True love passes through
Looks like we've got a wreck, babe
Up on Blue Avenue
Up on Blue Avenue
Blue AvenueI found my thrill
On Blueberry Hill
On Blueberry Hill
When I found you
The moon stood still
On Blueberry Hill
And lingered until
My dreams came true

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be
Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry Hill

The wind in the willow played
Love's sweet melody
But all of those vows we made
Were never to be

Though we're apart
You're part of me still
For you were my thrill
On Blueberry HillBlue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep blue sea
On a blue blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the morning comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes
Holding back the tears
Holding back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear blue sky
Watching over me
Blue eyes
I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again


Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see


Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again


Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again
Your old man got mad when I told him we were leaving
He cursed and he raged and he swore at the ceiling
He called you his child, said honey get wise to his game
He'll get you in trouble I know it, those bums are all the same


There's a Greyhound outside in the lane, it's waiting for us
So tell him goodbye, we gotta go west on that bus


And it's all over now
Don't you worry no more
Gonna go west to the sea
The Greyhound is swaying
And the radio's playing
Some blues for baby and me
And the highway looks like it never did
Lord, it looks so sweet and so free
And I can't forget that trip to the west
Singing blues for baby and me


Saw your hands trembling, your eyes opened in surprise
It's ninety in the shade babe, and there ain't a cloud in the sky
I called you my child, said honey now this is our game
There's two of us to play it and I'm happy to be home again

He wasn't famous but I sure did love him
I've got his picture in a little frame
He lost his life to a big disease before it even had a name
But there's so many more and I've lost count
The hows and whys aren't important now
All that matters is they came around
And brightened up our lives
She was twenty one with her life ahead
You don't need to know her name
She breathed her last on the cold stone floor of a Hollywood arcade
But fate's right hand isn't always just
Puts a lot of pressure on your faith and trust
She was just a little girl isn't that enough
To rage against the day


And how did we get so lucky 
Targets on the rifle range
Who makes the call and who gets to choose 
Who gets to win and who gets to lose 
It's like a rolling dice in the belly of the blues
And blues never fade away
Hey hey the colors run when the rain falls
But blues never fade away

Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a deep, blue sea
On a blue, blue day
Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
When the mornin' comes
I'll be far away
And I say

Blue eyes, holdin' back the tears
Holdin' back the pain
Baby's got blue eyes
And she's alone again


Blue eyes
Baby's got blue eyes
Like a clear, blue sky
Watchin' over me
Blue eyes
Ooh, I love blue eyes
When I'm by her side
Where I long to be
I will see


Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home, and I am home again


Blue eyes, laughin' in the sun
Laughin' in the rain
Baby's got blue eyes
And I am home again
Every breath is a prayer of some kind
I breathe in, I breathe out, I just breathe
And you're so well, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me


Like swimming in your eyes
I dive in, I dive deep, I just swim
I lose myself in you, blue wonderful
Blue wonderful again

Don't you know where you go  I will follow
In your footsteps I find my own feet
Addicted like I am to the blues
Kind of blue of all the blues I need


Yesterday did someone else's song
In sixty-five summertime, don't let go
Long before you came, blue wonderful
The blue wonderful I know


Ain't just something I just left behind
In the past, far away, used to be
But your presence, my blue wonderful
Blue wonderful to me


Go where you want, when you want to
Just don't let the wind tear you free
Stick around the light that brings you home
Don't ever hang around with the breeze

Elton: Mama, just killed a man
Elton: Put a gun against his head
Elton: Pulled my trigger now he's dead
Elton: Mama, life had just begun
Elton: Now I've gone and thrown it all away

Elton: Mama, oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Elton: Didn't mean to make you cry
Elton: If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Elton: Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters

Elton: Too late, my time has come
Elton: Sends shivers down my spine
Elton: Body's aching all the time
Elton: Goodbye everybody, I've got to go
Elton: Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth

Audience: Mama
Elton: Oooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Elton: No, I don't want to die
Elton: Sometimes wish I'd never been born at all

I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche will you do the fandango 
Thunderbolts and lightning - very, very frightening me
Gallileo, gallileo
Gallileo, gallileo
Gallileo, figaro - magnifico-o-o-o-oh
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity

Mama, just killed a manNone
Crime in the streets
I read about it everyday in the papers
And justice needs and justice wants
But just in time, yeah's too late here
Oh, feels like I wasn't born there 
I feel just like a boogie pilgrim 


Boogie pilgrim
Hustled to get it
To get it together
Down on the jive talk
Down on the weather
Boogie pilgrim oh
Brother, I never felt better
No, I never felt better


Low life's complete
When you've lived that way out on the sidewalk

Oh, I got the speed, baby, you got the need, ah, huh
But the need in me needs nothing

But I know that you all want something
Oh, just like a boogie pilgrim, boogie pilgrim

You've been crying and there ain't no use denying
It was me who put you through this misery
And I'd like to say I'm sorry but I can't, no I can't
Nothing's going to change me, baby, that's the way I am


I was born bad, always been the same
Yes, I was born bad, never gonna change
'Cause I was born bad, only me to blame
I was born bad
Yes, I was born bad, always been my habit
I was born bad, just can't seem to help it
I was born bad, always going to happen
I was born bad, I was born bad

I mistreat you and you know I always cheat you
But that's me and that's the way it's always been
And I'd like to say I'm sorry but I can't, no I can't
Nothing's gonna change me, baby, that's the way I am


I was born bad, always been the same
Yes, I was born bad, never gonna change
'Cause I was born bad, only me to blame
I was born bad
Yes, I was born bad, always been my habit
I was born bad, just can't seem to help it
I was born bad, always going to happen
I was born bad, I was born bad


Born bad, I was born bad
Born bad, I was born bad


I was born bad, always been the same
I was born bad, never gonna change
I was born bad, only me to blame
I was born bad
I was born bad, always been my habit
I was born bad, just can't seem to help it
I was born bad, always going to happen
I was born bad, 'cause I was born bad

We weren't born to stand still
Ain't a question of will
Gotta move it's a fact
You were born to react
You weren't made to behave
Like you will in the grave

Where mu-sic is played
Oh the soul - will be swayed
And your feet they will move
As if on - ly to prove
That it was  n't by chance
We were des - tined to dance
We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Cos we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation
Come on and shake per bootie
Cos we were born to boogie
Anyone can get it
Cos we're born kinetic
Come on and Mash Potat-a
The way God made pa

Your feet and your hands
Oh your toes and your glands
Your eyes and your chin
Your face and your skin
Oh your brawn and your brains
Your balls and your chains

We were born to boogie
We were born to boogie
It ain't a puzzle
Coo we're blood and muscle
From the day of creation
We were the dance sensation

Born to lose
I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose
And now I'm losing you


Born to lose
Oh it seems so hard to bear
When I wake and find that you're not there
Ooh you've grown tired and now you say we're through
I'm born to lose
And now I'm losing you

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain
Every dream has only brought me pain
All my life I've always been so blue
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
Born to lose and now I'm losing you
None
I recall how it used to be
In my younger days
I built a wall all around my heart
To keep the pain away
I built it tall and I built it wide
I left no room for doubt
Your love still found its way inside
And couldn't get back out


I'm breaking down the barriers
Making up my mind
I'm breaking down the barriers of time
I'm taking down the barriers
And loving what I find
I'm breaking down the barriers that lie
Between your love and mine


I guess you know you were not the first
You may not be the last
But you have shown me a better way
And now I'm learning fast
You gotta go where the feeling flows
I take it while it's hot
You gotta give if you wanna to get
And I want all you've got

They used to say that boys are tough as nails
In every way he keeps his heart as guarded as a jail
Now things have changed, I feel so old
Like any girl could drag my heart across the coals
I was always there in the thick of things
I always had the heart of every woman on a string
The danger zone shone from my eyes
It seemed like every inch I gained became a mile


It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be

And now I know what lonely means
I used to give so little and gain everything
The darkest part of every day
Is the shadow of another girl as she turns and walks away
Can't say I blame them all for being hurt
After all I treated each and every one like dirt
Who wants a heart that's never home
I face the facts and lock myself into a life alone


It's not the night reaching in and touching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It seems that time has killed that cruel streak in me
And breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
It's not the light shining in and catching me
It's just that breaking hearts ain't what it used to be
But time has come and cast a spell on me
And breaking hearts, breaking hearts, breaking hearts
Breaking hearts ain't what it used to beWhen you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all

I'm on your side
When times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you

I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down

Sail on Silver Girl
Sail on by
Your time has come to shine
All your dreams are on their way

See how they shine
If you need a friend
I'm sailing right behind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will ease your mind
Leve a plateia   loucura
Eu quero ver lacrar
Todo palco   um ringue
V  com tudo, arrebente
Quebre as pernas dessa gente
Mostre o que a dan a tem pra dar
Prove pro mundo que veio
Brilhar

I'm building a bird
From the wreck of a story
Something I once heard
Sifting through this pile of words
I'm building a bird

I'm building a bird
From a crack in the system
Sunshine, it's a dirty word
Slippin' out this naked world
And building a bird

Take a broken bird home
Wrap it in barbed wire
Saddest song I ever heard
Was a bird in a house on fire

I'm building a bird
From the wreck of a story
Something I once heard
Sifting through this pile of words
I'm building a bird

All this scattered makeup
From covering his curse
All the scattered building blocks
That never got to build a bird
You tell me there's an angel in your tree
Did he say he'd come to call on me
For things are getting desperate in our home
Living in the parish of the restless folks I know

Everybody now bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Burn down the mission
If we're gonna stay alive
Watch the black smoke fly to heaven
See the red flame light the sky
Burn down the mission
Burn it down to stay alive
It's our only chance of living
Take all you need to live inside

Deep in the woods the squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn burn burn burn down the mission walls

Bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps
It's time we put the flame torch to their keep

Chorus

But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn, down the mission walls 


Now everybody, bring your family down to the riverside
Look to the east to see where the fat stock hide
Behind four walls of stone the rich man sleeps

Deep in the woods, squirrels are out today
My wife cried when they came to take me away, yeah
But what more could I do just to keep her warm
Than burn, burn, burn, burn down the mission walls 
None
It used to be a sweet sensation
No price too high for love
Now I pay for this bitter taste
And the price is not enough
Such cruel sport for your kicks
Such hard knocks on my heart
How long before the pain ends
Tell me where living starts


And lovers leap off burning buildings
Waking up on a sky high wire
Desperation leaves us clinging
On the edge of a house on fire
Lovers leap off burning buildings
Live our life on borrowed time
Every flame that ever moved you
Touched your lips but never mine
Lovers leap off burning buildings


No room for conversation
Cold stares and angry words
Fall in pieces from our faces
We read "do not disturb"
Some lovers just go hungry
Others beg for just a bite
You use me under pressure
To whet your appetite
Written by George and Ira Gershwin
From Four Weddings and a Funeral soundtrack

They're writing songs of love, but not for me
A lucky star's above, but not for me
With love to lead the way, I've found more clouds are grey
Than any Russian play could guarantee

I was a fool to fall and get that way
Heigh ho, alas, and also lack-a-day
Although I can't dismiss the memory of her kiss
I guess she's not for me

It all began so well, but what an end
This is the time a feller needs a friend
When every happy plot ends with a marriage knot
And there's no knot for meSober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed

Like flags of many nations
Flying high above her head
The cellophane is still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand

As whispers circulate all day
Their backstage baby princess passed away
You can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
You can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings

'Cause she'll soar like a hawk when sh  flies
But she'll die lik  an eagle
When she die

Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found beneath the sheets

Let down before the final curtain
The shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss oh to the faithful fans
Who'd miss her

You can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
You can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings

Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different
To how they looked last night
A pale face pressed to an unmade bed
Like flags of many nations flying high above her head
The cellophane still on the flowers
The telegram still in her hand
As whispers circulate all day
Their back-stage baby princess passed away


And you can cage the songbird
But you can't make her sing
And you can trap the free bird
But you'll have to clip her wings
'Cause she'll soar like a hawk when she flies
But she'll dive like an eagle when she dies



Promises of no more lies
Fell flat upon an empty stage
Before the audience arrived
A return in time to the cheaper seats
She never knew what lay beneath
Just a dated handbill they found between the sheets
Let down before the final curtain
A shallow heart that left her cold
She left in rouge upon the mirror
A circled kiss, oh, to the faithful fans who'd miss her

On a hill long ago, on a cold winter's night
In a land far away, three kings saw a light
And from heaven it shone like God's, God's own crown
And it guided three kings into Bethlehem town


Oh, they came bearing gifts and so said each one
"Let's call this day Christmas from this moment on"
"We'll be calling it Christmas in, in honor of Him"
"The child in the manger, our savior and king"
Oh-ho-ooh

We've been calling it Christmas
Keeping the faith
Knowing the reason we're
We're saving the day
We've been calling it
We've been calling it Christmas, ooh
Down through the years
Down through the years, baby
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Is here


Oh, a simple belief was the start of it all
A small child asleep on a bed made of straw
At the back of an inn where, where shepherds and kings
First felt the joy that this moment would bring
We've been calling it
We've been calling it Christmas
Keeping the faith
Knowing the reason
We're saving the day
We've been calling it
We've been calling it Christmas
Down through the years
Down through the years, baby
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas
When Christmas
Is here
Is here
We've been calling it Christmas
Oh, baby
Down through the years
Down through, down through the years
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Ooh-ooh, yeah
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas is here
Christmas is here
Oh, oh, yeah
Spreading joy to the world when Christmas
Ooh-ooh
Is here
Is here, hmm

Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled


They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on a treadmill
And they made you change your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
The candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did


Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid


Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
Well I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid

Your legend ever did

Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch, we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years


And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will


Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed yourself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you will ever know

Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself

Your legend ever did


Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name


It seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long b fore
Your legend  ver did

Goodbye, Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye, Norma Jeane
From the young man in the twenty-second row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe

The sound of one heart breaking, the sound of someone waking
To the cold hard truth before the sun goes down
If I could ever catch you a little bit of that
I'd wrap it up and bury it in the deep dark ground

On the ledge with one last chance to beg
To the deepest root of the oldest tree
If we could only bottle a little bit of rain
Wrung out from the history in its ancient leaves

All we need is a candlelit bedroom
All you ever wanted was a state of grace
Every waking moment you believe that
Love will always lead you to a better place

The never ending stories of the victor and the spoils
The treasure and the lesson to be learned
If I could ever wrap up a little piece of this
I'd strike a match and watch the contents burn

Every waking moment you believe that
You must have a little faith in the light of love

Well I'm keeping off the streets since you came to town
Since you claimed my heart from the lost and found
I have said goodbye to my fooling around
Now you and me babe we got candy by the pound
You and me babe we got candy by the pound
Well I never knew it could feel so good
Be the king of the hill in my neighbourhood
Rain on my roof what a sweet sound
Oh with you underneath it's like candy by the pound
With you underneath it's like candy by the pound

You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound


Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh wow I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound


Now I'm ducking in the alley of common sense
Hiding from the claws of my old girlfriend
She's screaming murder beating my door down
While I'm right behind it I'm eating candy by the pound
I'm right behind it eating I'm candy by the pound


You can tell everybody that this girl of mine
Is sweeter than the grapes hanging from the vine
Love like wine honey drinking till I drown
Keep it coming baby like candy by the pound


Oh no what's come over me
If I am dreaming then let me sleep
Oh good God, I'm heaven bound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound
Love is getting sweeter than candy by the pound
Your love is sweeter, it's so much sweeter
It's sweeter than candy by the pound
Your love is sweeter, it's so much sweeter
It's sweeter than candy by the pound
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Sweeter baby
Love is so much sweeter, baby
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
Sweeter than candy by the pound
I work for the foundry for a penny and a half a day
Like a blind street musician, I never see those who pay
It's dirty work in Birmingham, better deal for a Sheffield man
If he can rivet then his kids can buy
Candy from the candy man


And the van that comes around weekends
Selling fancy city things
Sold by the man with the trilby hat
And the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

Can I put you on  People, can I put you on 
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on


And a second cousin works in the pits in Newcastle on Tyne
And he don't care if it rains outside, there's coal dust on his mind
It's dirty work in Manchester but the crew gets paid its gelt
Bang on the bell on Friday
You buys a little something for yourself


And the van that comes around weekends selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat and the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing


Can I put you on  People, can I put you on 
Tell you that I love you, people
Sing a salesman's song and put you on


And the van that comes around weekends selling fancy city things
Sold by the man in the trilby hat and the whiskers spread like wings
You can hear him sing
Oh, you can hear him sing

At last i'm over losing you
I've cried so many tears it just ain't true
My eyes are red, my heart is blue
I can't get over getting over losing you

I can't turn back the hands of time
I've come so far, i have to see it through
The trouble is that i still find
I can't get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you
Except in the morning and then in the evening, again in the afternoon
I guess it's true, i'm over the worst
But living's the one thing that ain't rehearsed

But i know that's all behind me now
I'm learning how to live my life anew
And as soon as i discover how
Then i'll get over getting over losing you

I hardly ever think of you, i roll with the punches
I'm taking it easy, i don't play hunches like i used to do
I'm over you now
Still tying to forget you but i don't know how

I blew the dust out of the corners
Threw some dead wood on the fire
Tuned the radio to silence
Watched the evening sun expire
Should have called you up this morning
But I'm such a fool at times
I still search my shaving mirror
Looking for your face with mine


And I can't stay alone tonight
Can't let another day go by
Why is it always this way 
Time never seems to really fly
And time is never really on my side
And I can't stay alone tonight
Things have to change and they might
But I can't stay alone tonight


Chalk up one more crazy notion
Imagination running wild
But if I needed confirmation
I would have gone that extra mile
You're the last chance on the highway
I'm that open stretch of road
You're the diner in my rear-view
A cup of coffee getting cold
None
I can see what's happening 
And they don't have a clue 
They'll fall in love and here's the bottom line
Our trio's down to two 
The sweet caress of twilight 
There's magic everywhere 
And with all this romantic atmosphere
Disaster's in the air


Can you feel the love tonight 
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things

So many things to tell h r
But how to make her see
The truth about my past  Impossibl 
She'd turn away from me


He's holding back, he's hiding
But what, I can't decide
Why won't he be the king I know he is
The king I see inside 


Can you feel the love tonight 
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living things
Can you feel the love tonight 
You needn't look too far
Stealing through the night's uncertainties
Love is where they are


And if he falls in love tonight
It can be assumed
His carefree days with us are history
In short, our pal is doomed
There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It s enough for this restless warrior just to be with you


And can you feel the love tonight 
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far
And can you feel the love tonight 
How it's laid to rest
It s enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twistin' kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours

Captain Fantastic raised and regimented, hardly a hero
Just someone his mother might know
Very clearly a case for corn flakes and classics
"Two teas both with sugar please", in the back of an alley
While little Dirt Cowboys turned brown in their saddles
Sweet chocolate biscuits and red rosy apples in summer
For it's hay make and "Hey mom
Do the papers say anything good 
Are there chances in life for little Dirt Cowboys 
Should I make my way out of my home in the woods "

Brown Dirt Cowboy, still green and growing
City slick Captain
Fantastic the feedback, the honey the hive could be holding
For there's weak winged young sparrows that starve in the winter
Broken young children on the wheels of the winners
And the '68 summer festival wallflowers are thinning


For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town


And all this talk of Jesus coming back to see us
Hmm, couldn't fool us
For we were spinning out our lines walking on the wire
Hand in hand went music and the rhyme
The Captain and the Kid stepping in the ring
From here on sonny sonny sonny, it's a long and lonely climb


For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
For cheap easy meals are hardly a home on the range
Too hot for the band with a desperate desire for change
We've thrown in the towel too many times
Out for the count and when we're down
Captain Fantastic and the Brown Dirt Cowboy
From the end of the world to your town
NoneNoneI woke up long after dawn
Twenty years had come and gone
I know when it changed for me
A day in June, you came to me
I've seen through someone else's eyes
With nothin' on the other side
Every motel, every town
Pieces scattered all around

Promises that I can't be
Someone's heart that I can't keep
Days so long, I couldn't speak
Roads so rocky, I can't sleep
I've seen things so beautiful
All around this broken world
That pale in comparison to you

Caroline, I'm on my way back home to you
Can't imagine what I'm goin' through
Without you by my side
It's been a long long time
Oh won't you say a prayer for me
I hope you will remember me
You're always on my mind


I have seen the canyon lands
Crooked lines like in your hands
You'd swear the earth was split in two
I wouldn't lie, I promise you
That I have seen it, you will too
You could not believe if not for
Photographs I took for you
Caroline
If your life is dull and dreary
And you're feeling rather weary
Of the mundane things that clutter up one's life
Drive your roller up to Bond Street
Where royalty and Sheiks meet
Make your day
Here's the thing to do
Spend a grand or two at Cartier
Come on, gang! Let's take it home!


Whoo! Ah ha ha ha ha!



Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata
Hakuna matata


It means no worries
For the rest of your days
It's our problem-free philosophy
Hakuna matata


Can you feel it 
Can you feel the love tonight 


Can you feel the love tonight  
The peace the evening brings 
The world for once in perfect harmony
With all its living things

All my friends are travelers, we don't often get to meet
But I know they're out there somewhere
And the knowin' keeps me sweet
Now some go out in limousines
And some leave on their feet
And I never really feel as if they're gone
No, I never really feel as if they're gone


Amanda's like my sister, and she's out there in LA
But the wings of love fly straight and true
So we keep in touch that way
Now, there's other friends less sensitive
I guess they'll use the phone someday
And we watch the wheels of life keep spinning on
Yes, we watch the wheels of life keep spinning on


Now the chain of love keeps growing
And the world keeps getting small
And soon there won't be room enough to separate us all
When the voice of love grows strong enough
It could break down any wall
And you'll hear it call, you'll hear it call

The last I heard of you
You were somewhere on a cruise in the Mediterranean
So imagine my surprise
To see you very much alive in the English rain again


And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it


Oh, chameleon, you're stealing your way back into my eyes
Beyond a shadow of a doubt, you're a devil, you're a devil in disguise
Do you really change me or am I going crazy 
Chameleon, chameleon, chameleon, you're free again, my child


I remember still those lazy summer days
We'd kill out hunting danger
And we were alien to all outsiders
We had no desire to talk to strangers


And I can still recall wet afternoons
When we were small and simply childish
But you've created your own ghost
And the need you have is more than most to hide it
Spring is here, the sky is blue
Birds will sing as if they knew
Today's the day, we'll say "I do"
And we'll never be lonely any more

Because we're going to the chapel
And we're gonna to get married
Going to the chapel
And we're gonna get married
Gee I really love you
And we're gonna get married
Going to the chapel of love

Bells will ring, the sun will shine
I will be hers, and she'll be mine
We'll love until the end of time
And we'll never be lonely any more
I built a wall in China, I sank an ocean liner
I've wrecked homes, I've burned thrones, chasing the crown
I've put thorns in your feet, I spread plague in the streets
I've sprung traps, confused maps, chasing the crown


Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown

I saw the tea float in Boston, I saw the live wire shock 'em
I made them float, I made them drown, chasing them 'round
I laid the desert sands, I froze the polar caps
Well, they'd dry out, and I'd shout "Hey, I'm chasing the crown"


Chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips when the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown 





I'm chasing the crown 'til he bites the apple
I was licking my lips 'til the sun come down
I'm chasing the crown, crown, I'm chasing the crown
I'm taking a turn in the right direction
By leaving his soul in the lost and found
I'm chasing the crown, I'm chasing the crown


Chicago, nothing here for me
You got to set me free, Chicago
Chicago, ain't a home for a girl alone
Chicago

There ain't one soul in this town that I ever found
Who cares if I live or if I die
One of these days I'm gonna pack up my bags
Put a smile on my face and say goodbye

Say goodbye to Chicago
Chicago, got no hold on me
You gotta set me free, Chicago
Chicago, streets are cold
Chill me to my very soul

I'm gonna go somewhere where people aren't so scared
To show that they care
And they're likely to b  kind
I'm gonna erase ev ry memory of this place

Get it out of my mind
Leave it behind
Chicago
Lord, how I yearn to be able to turn
And not to find somebody waitin' to shoot me down

Well you can bump and grind
It is good for your mind
Well you can twist and shout
Let it all hang out
But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no


Well you can Terraplane
In the falling rain
I drive a Rolls-Royce
'Cause it's good for my voice


But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, no, no

Yeah


But you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No, you won't fool the children of the revolution
No way!
How come you're so understanding
When I tell you all my lies 
And pretending to believe them
See through all my alibis
And I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe


How you handle what you live through
I can never hope to learn
Taking all the pain I give you
Loving blindly in return
And I need you more than ever
I will always be your friend, Chloe
Chloe


Chloe, what you gonna do 'bout me 
Chloe, what you gonna do 
What you going to do 'bout me 


You're the lifeline that I cling to
When I feel like giving in
When the dreams that I rely on
Start to wear a little thin
Then I need you more than ever
And I want you till the end, Chloe, mm
Chloe
None
Where do I belong 


Tell me your story and I'll tell you mine
I'm all ears, take your time, we've got all night
Show me the rivers crossed, the mountains scaled
Show me who made you walk all the way here


Ooh
Settle down, put your bags down
Ooh
You're alright now


We don't need to be related to relate
We don't need to share genes or a surname
You are, you are
My chosen, chosen family
So what if we don't look th  same 
We been going through the sam  thing, yeah
You are, you are
My chosen, chosen family


Hand me a pen and I'll rewrite the pain
When you're ready, we'll turn the page together
Open a bottle, it's time we celebrate
Who you were, who you are
We're one and the same, yeah

He called us slobbering!


Said we were mangy!


Did I hear stupid 


Huh 


Tell us again, gee
It's so incredible


That you're so rude


When you're so edible


When you are food!

The Circle of Life

It's the Circle of Life
And it moves us all
Through despair and hope
Through faith and love
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the Circle



From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen
More to do than can ever be done

There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found
But the sun rolling high
Through the sapphire sky
Keeps great and small on the endless round
From the day we arrive on the planet
And blinking, step into the sun
There's more to see than can ever be seen

Some say, "Eat or be eaten"
Some say, "Live and let live"
But all are agreed as they join the stampede
You should never take more than you give


The circle of life
It's the wheel of fortune
It's the leap of faith
It's the band of hope
Till we find our place
On the path unwinding
The circle, the circle of life


Some of us fall by the wayside
And some of us soar to the stars
And some of us sail through our troubles
And some have to live with the scars, yeah
There's far too much to take in here
More to find than can ever be found

Keeps great and small on the endless round

I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream
I know you, that look in your eyes is so familiar a gleam

And I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem
But if I know you, I know what you'll do
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream

You'll Be In My Heart - Tarzan

You'll be in my heart
Yes, you'll be in my heart
From this day on
Now and forevermore

You'll be in my heart
No matter what they say
You'll be here in my heart, always

Part of Your World -  The Little Mermaid

I want to be where the people are
I want to see
Want to see 'em dancin'
Walkin' around on those
 oh - feet
Up where they walk
Up where they run
Up where they stay all day in the sun
Wandering free
Wish I could be
Part of that world

You're holding back
You're hard to read
Your a 21st century kind
You're lighting fast
Built for speed
A tight lipped modern mind
An architect
Of grand romance
You're a mystery of disguise
You're holed up in your house
Just waiting for the fire
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

You're gonna need a claw hammer
Oh my Lord
To bust on through
And break down your walls
Loosen your lips
Slacken that jaw
It's gonna take a claw hammer
Oh my Lord


Look at us fools
Being used
We're totally dumb, surprised
Waiting for you to share with us
The myth behind the lies
Come on out
Throw us a bone
We want to know your intentions
Are you fake
For goodness sake
Or the Mother of Invention
You're buttoned down
All sown up
You're an ontological soul
Cold hard truth
Only proof
What we already know

Have my love, it fits you like a glove
Join my dream, tell me, yes
Bail out, should there be a mess
The pieces you don't need are mine


Take my time, I'll show you cloud nine
Take my smile and my heart
They were yours from the start
The pieces to omit are mine

Have my love, use it while it does you good
Share my highs but the times
That it hurts, pay no mind
Those pieces you don't need are mine
I'll see you there on cloud nine




Take my hope, maybe even share a joke
If there's good to be shown
You may make it all your own
And if you want to quit, that's fine
While you're out looking for cloud nine
When the shades are drawn
And the light of the moon is banned
And the stars up above
Walk the heavens hand in hand

There's a shady place
At the end of the working day
Where young lovers go
And this hot little trio plays

That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

Ooh, where we meet
Ooh, where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street


From the alleyways
Where the catwalks gently sway
You hear the sound of Otis
And the voice of Marvin Gaye

In this smoky room
There's a jukebox plays all night
And we can dance real close
Beneath the pulse of a neon light


That's where we meet
That's where we meet
Me and you rendezvous
In the club at the end of the street

You don't love him any more
He threw your rag doll out the door
I keep my distance
I held my breath
Love always ends up
Hanging by a thread


Love hurts so much
Love leaves a scar
'I don't love you' is like a stake
Being driven through your heart


But I don't care
I came back for you
Love is cruel, but I don't care
I wanted you
And I'm cold
Cold
Cold


You said, "Don't cry to me"
He said, "I'm a dead man if you leave"
I have no feelings, I have no heart
Love always cuts out
The warm and tender part

We still sit at separate tables
And we sleep at different times
And the warm wind in the palm trees
Hasn't helped to change our minds
It was the lure of the tropics
That I thought might heal the scars
Of a love burned out by silence
In a marriage minus heart


And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year

The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year 


I dreamed of love in a better climate
And for what it's really worth
I put faith in the star we followed
To this Caribbean surf
But there's an icy fringe on everything
And I cannot find the lines
Where's the beauty in the beast we made
Why the frost in the summertime


And I call the kids on the telephone
Say there's something wrong out here
It's July but it's cold as Christmas
In the middle of the year


The temperature's up to ninety five
But there's a winter look in your mother's eyes
And to melt the tears there's a heat wave here
So how come it's cold as Christmas in the middle of the year 






It's a human sign
When things go wrong
When the scent of her lingers
And temptation's strong


Cold, cold heart
Hardened by you 
Some things lookin' better, baby
Just passin' through 


And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find

Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid

Oh no, no, noYour life stepped lightly out our hands
When no one's looking out you understand
Your world was a wheel but the cog ceased to turn
The bottom fell out and our fingers got burned

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

Every new version of the way of life
Leaves you reckless and searching for stars in the night
But whose kid are you when they finally decide
The lifestyle you led and the way that you died
And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end

But they're oh so simple, they're still trying to tell
The difference for you between heaven and hell
To glorify something, your legends are found
But all they bought you was a hole in the ground

Years rolling by just like a dream 
I'm partly human and I'm partly machine
They've lost you and fate put your name on a stone 
Perhaps now my friend they might leave you alone 

And there's a cold, cold highway that the wind whistles down
Where the corners turn blind like the graveyard ground
Oh your black icy stare once cut down my friend
In the deepest dark winter when the world seemed to end
If you want it, here it is, come and get it
Make your mind up fast
If you want it anytime, I can give it
But you better hurry because it may not last


Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast



Did I hear you say that there must be a catch
Will you walk away from a fool and his money, sonny
If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast
You better hurry because it's going fast
Fool and his money, sonny


If you want it here it is, come and get it
But you better hurry because it's going fast
You better hurry because it's going fastCome back baby

In the quiet silent seconds
I turned off the light switch
And I came down to meet you
In the half light the moon left
While a cluster of night jars
Sang some songs out of tune
A mantle of bright light s
Shone down from a room

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way
Well I don't know if I should have heard her as yet
But a true love like hers is a hard love to get
And I've walked most all the way and I ain't heard her call
And I'm getting to thinking if she's coming at all

Come down in time I still hear her say
So clear in my ear like it was today
Come down in time was the message she gave
Come down in time and I'll meet you half way

While some leave you counting the stars in the night

Some funny things used to happen to me,
About 1956-57

At that time there was no blues scene
Or not really any kind of scene in London
I used to go out and play my guitar in the streets
And sing things with passing my hat down

I remember one particular night
I was playing the guitar in a little alleyway
Just off of Wardour Street in Soho
And I got busted by the police
This policeman came up and dragged me and my guitar
And my hat full of pennies off to the police station

Anyway, the next day
I had to appear in Marlboro Street Police Court
And it was quite a day
Police officer giving his evidence

"I was proceeding in a southerly direction, mi-lord
When I heard strange sounds
Coming from Wardour Place, mi-lord
A sort of boogie-woogie music was being played

On further investigation, I saw the defendant
Standing there with a guitar and an old hat
On the floor collecting pennies
Well, I decided that he was contravening

A breach of the peace there, as there was
A traffic jam about five miles long down Wardour Street
Wondering what all the fuss was about

So then I arrested the defendant"
"Ah, just one moment, officer
Well, what is this boogie-woogie music
Here we're talking about "
Music by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

The night we met, we stood
Divided by defenses as old as time
But love has found a way
To bring me to your senses and you to mine

So we meet in the cloak of evening
And we try to go on believing
Two different worlds can still be one
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
The night we met, we knew
What love would soon be leading us to do
And so it goes, and now
When wanting turns to needing, i turn to you

And it's hard to go on deceiving
But we have to go on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun

As i lie here and feel you breathing
It's not hard to keep on believing
That someday our love will overcome
You and me, you and me, you and me, we can conquer the sun
When I was a little bitty baby
My Momma done rocked me in the cradle
In them old cottonfields back home
It was back in Louisiana
Just about a mile from Texarkana
In them old cottonfields back home


Let me tell you now well I got me in a mess
I caught a nail in my tire doing lickety splits
I had to walk a long long way to town




Came along a nice old man
Well he had a hammer
Wait a minute mister, can you get me some direction
I'm gonna wanna be right off for home
Oh, let them cotton balls get rotten
I got you baby, who needs cotton
In them old cottonfields back home
Well, it sure feels good to breathe the air back home
You should have seen their faces when they seen how I'd grown
In them old cotton fields back homeSoon the pines will be falling everywhere
Village children fight each other for a share
And the 6:09 goes roaring past the creek
Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really going fine for eighty four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl she needs a hand to run the farm

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it cuts man-power by fifteen
Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

Now the old fat goose is flying cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch
Soon the pines will be falling everywhere
As the village children fight each other for their share
And the six-to-nine goes roaring past the creek
As Deacon Lee prepares his sermon for next week
I saw Grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really doing fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I could fix her barn
The poor old girl she needs a hand to run that farm


And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort and a truck that's going back home
Oh it's going back home

Down at the well they've got a new machine
The foreman says it'll cut manpower by fifteen
"Hey but that is not natural" old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day


And it's good old country comfort in my bones
It's the sweetest sound these ears have ever known
It's just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort and a truck that's going back home
Oh it's going back home


Country comfort and a truck that's going back home
Whoa, it's going back home
Hey take me back home
And a truck, and a truck that's going back home
Any truckSoon the pines will be falling everywhere

Yeah but that ain't natural well so old Clay would say
You see he's a horse-drawn man until his dying day

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home

Now the old fat goose is flying 'cross the sticks
The hedgehog's done in clay between the bricks
And the rocking chair's creaking on the porch
Across the valley moves the herdsman with his torch

And it's good old country comfort in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown
Country comfort's in a truck that's going home, ooh
Country comfort's in a truck that's going back home
Yes it is
Country comfort in a truck that's going back home

Village children always fighting for a share

Parson Lee prepares his service for next week
I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Well she's really looking fine for eighty-four
And she asked me if sometime I'd fix the barn
Poor old girl, she needs a man down on the farm


And it's good old country comforts in my bones
Just the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling in my bones
Country comfort's any road that's going home, woohoo




Down at the well they've got a new machine
Foreman says it cuts manpower by fifteen
"And oh, but that ain't natural" old man Clayson says

I saw grandma yesterday down at the store
Man, she's really going fine for eighty-four
Well she asked me if sometime I'd fix her barn
Poor old girl, she needs a hand to run the farm

'Bout the sweetest sound my ears have ever known
Just an old-fashioned feeling fully-grown

All the mysteries
Hanging with the guys, making with the guys
Playing hard to please

Back in '63, she was made for me
We were having fun
Wasn't long before I could not ignore
She's about hanging out
Campus queen dreams shattered years ago
And I'm the one who knows
It's the same country love song
Different words, a different melody
It's the same country love song

Mama said to me, John you got to be
Honest to yourself
Keeping up the pace, losing in the race
Further on the shelf

I want to write a country love song, tell them nothing's wrong
Suzie did my heart
There is nothing more, something said before
C'est la vie, mon cherie
Lady Luck, me and sexy so-and-so
And I'm the one who knowsNone
On a bench, on the beach
Just before the sun had gone
I tried to reach you
Plain faced and falling fast
You looked so vacant like an empty shell
Whose life had passed upon the ocean
Mmm hmm


Before light shook the sky
Down by the docks I saw
The masts unfolding
Don't turn away, please understand
It's a life and a living
And a way to keep the wolves away
From hungry hands, from hungry hands

Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water
Crazy water


Tangled lives, lonely wives
Shoreline widows pray
For the souls of missing whalers
Endless nights on an endless sea
Where nothing lives between us
Just the breakers on the ocean
Separating you and me
Ooh, separating you and me


Crazy water
Takes my fishing boat on Monday morning
Dangerous dreaming
If we all believe in the things you believe you're seeing
Oh, we'd never drop our nets in the crazy water

I remember when rock was young
Gnomeo and Julie had so much fun
Gnomeo nights crying by the record machine
Had an old gold buggy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the Crocodile Rock
While the other kids were rocking 'round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the Crocodile Rock

Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still
I never knew me a better time, and I guess I never will
Eh! Everybody is feeling right
Because we're gonna dance all night
And the Crocodile Rocking was something of sight
Yeah, Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!


Laa, la-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa
La-la-la-la-laa


But the years went by and the rock never died
Juliet went and left Gnomeo for some foreign guy
Long nights crying by the record machine
Dreaming of my Chevy and my old blue jeans
Cause they'll never kill the thrills we've got
Burning up to the Crocodile Rock
Learning fast as the weeks went past
We really thought the Crocodile Rock would last


Crocodile Rocking is something shocking
When your feet just can't keep still

Oh, lawdy mama, those Friday nights
When Susie wore her dresses tight

Grab a line, love someone, then hurry past your time
Never stop to touch the things you want most
Take a look and run
Wear a smile, hide behind that masquerade awhile
Don't you know I looked, and then I saw you
Crying in the sun


And though I've tried to find out how you feel
You just looked through your shadow
And tell me it was real
Now there's nothing much I can do
Now there's nothing much coming through


Play the youth, till you find there's no time like the truth
Holding all the love you could be giving
Till you stand undone


And though I've tried to find out how you feel
You just looked through your shadow
And tell me it was real
Now there's nothing much I can do
'Cause now there's nothing much coming through

We're caught up in a web, you and I
Since Crystal came between us
The knots of friendship seem to be untied
And it hurts me most to cheat and that's no lie
She can swing us both forever
In the long run she's the one who must decide


And if she leaves me handle her with care
Don't hurt little Crystal
And if she calls you long distance just be there
Oh Crystal
The world is your oyster, you're a pearl
But he's a jewel and my friend
I'm sure that in the end, Crystal you'll be his little girl
Oh Crystal


You're stronger than me but I'm sure
That the fight would fall to no one
The cold hard truth is stronger than us all
And it breaks my heart to see us go this far
We're just captives in our separate cells
And without her there's no peace behind these bars

I found a black beret on the street today
It was lying in the gutter all torn
There's a white flag flying on a tall building
But the kids just watch the storm
Their dirty faces pressed on the windows
Shattered glass before their eyes
There's a mad dog barking in a burned out subway
Where the sniper sleeps at night


No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven

There are many graves by a cold lake
As the beds were when your babies are born
And your rag doll sits with a permanent grin
I saw a black cat tease a white mouse
Until he killed it with his claws
Seems a lot of countries do the same thing
Before they go to war


No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven
No birthday songs to sing again
Just bricks and stones to give them
Wrap them up in your father's flags
And let them cry to heaven


Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to Heaven
Let them cry to HeavenNone
I used to know this old scarecrow
He was my song
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
Of a field no longer sown by anyone
I held a dandelion
That said the time had come
To leave upon the wind
Not to return
When summer burned the earth again
Oh...
Oh...

Cultivate the freshest flower
This garden ever grew
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
But that's okay
There's treasure children always seek to find
And just like us
You must have had
A once upon a time


It's knowing what they want of me that scares me
It's knowing, having followed, I must lead
It's knowing that each person there compares me
To those in my past whom I now succeed
But how can whatever I do for them now be enough 
Be enough


Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!


Your robe should be golden, your robe should be perfect
Instead of this ragged concoction of thread
But may you be moved by its desperate beauty
To give us new life, for we'd rather be dead
Then live in the squalor and shame of the slave
To the dance!


Aida! Aida!
All we ask of you
Is a lifetime of service, wisdom, courage
To ask more would be selfish, but nothing less will do
Aida! Aida!
Have you ever had a good time turn bad
When the leaves turn brown
And the shattered glass just splinters
It's days like this that you can't resist
A long tall drink
And a big yellow sun in the winter

And you can go dancing
You can go dancing
You can go dancing
Dancing in the end zone

Did you ever pray you could stay away
Company excluded
From the curse of the family circle
In a big round room on the edge of the moon
There's a shooting star
In a race for the final hurdle

No need to worry, no need to worry
No need to worry when you dance alone
You already made it, you already made it
When you're dancing in the end zone
Can you tell me how old Dan might've done it
If he'd been here now, holy cow
My stars might've been read on the planet Mars
'Cause I don't have foresight to see
If we'll still be together in the twenty-first
In the twenty-first century, oh no


He's our flyin' ace, Pilot of the Future
In an endless space, holy cow
My eyes never saw a rocket that was quite that size
'Cause I don't have the energy
To be cat and mouse for the champions
For the champions of destiny, oh no


So long, Captain Dan
I fail to see what motivates your hands
Goodbye, restless night
You know I love Dan Dare, but I couldn't make his flight
So long, so long, yeah


Dan Dare doesn't know it
He doesn't know it, he doesn't know it
But I like the Mekon
Daniel is traveling tonight on a plane

Oh, I'm a dark diamond
I've turned hard and cold
Once was a jewel with fire in my soul
There's two sides of a mirror
One I couldn't break through
Stayed trapped on the inside, wound up losing you


Tell me how does it work
How do you make things fit
Spent all my life trying to get it right
I've put it together and it falls apart
I thought to myself I might understand
But when the wall's built
And the heart hardens
You get a dark diamond
Dark diamond


Oh, I'm a dark diamond
But you're something else
You read me more than I read myself
The one star I could count on
Only comet I could trust
You burnt through my life to the true meaning of love
When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done

When the day is done
Hope so much your race will be all run
Then you find you jumped the gun
Have to go back where you begun
When the day is done
When the night is cold
Some get by but some get old
Just to show life's not made of gold
When the night is cold

When the bird has flown
Got no one to call your own
Got no place to call your home
Now the bird has flown

When the game's been fought
Newspaper blowing across the court
Lost much sooner than you would have thought
Now the game's been fought

When the party's through
Seems so very sad for you
Didn't do the things you meant to do
Now there's no time to to start anew
Now the party's through

When the day is done
Down to Earth then sinks the sun
Along with everything that was lost and won
When the day is done
Day is done
When the day is done
Dear God, are you there
Can you hear me, do you care
Dear God, here are we
Less than perfect, far from free


Oh we take what we get and we don't take no more
But we sometimes forget what it was you created us for


Dear God, now's the time
If you're listening, show some sign
Dear God, hear me plead
Don't desert us in our need
Dear God, lend a hand
Is this really what you planned
Dear God, in you we trust
Though we've failed you, don't fail us


Oh we take what we get but we can't take much more
Do you sometimes forget what it was you created us for, dear God


I hope and pray you'll lead us to a brighter day
Out of the darkness and light up our way, dear God
I hope and pray you'll lead us to a better way
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
Light up our way dear God, dear God
Love is the answer so light up our way, dear God
I got home today, took a look around
Trying to find that girl of mine, she could not be found
All her things were gone, she just left a note
It don't take no mastermind to figure what she wrote


She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"

I don't want her back, I won't even try
This time ain't just au revoir, this time it's goodbye
We could not go on, living like we were
I was just about to write a 'Dear John' note to her


I was gonna say, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"




She said, "Dear John, I'm moving on
By this time I'm gonna be long gone
Dear John, c'est la vie, dear John
So long, you've seen the last of me"


Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm gonna
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long
Dear John, I'm moving on, by this time I'm gonna
Be long gone, dear John, c'est la vie, dear John, so long
The problem is for many years
I've lived my life publicly
So it's hard for me to find a man I trust
I really trust
And every time I find someone I like, gotta worry about
If it's really me that they see
And I thought you were the one, ohhhh...


Deep inside I wish that you could see

That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary
Deep inside I wish that you could see

That I'm just plain ol' Mary...Mary

I don't have a lot of friends
And sometimes I have to wonder
Is it cash they see when they look at me 
'Cause they're lookin' for a ride that's free
So I made the choice to be
Good to those who are good to me
Don't judge me or think I'm bitter
For the evil does allow me to see I'm just Mary


I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary
I'm just Mary, just Mary, just Mary

Oh once I was a young man
Looked over vales and hills
Saw myself a future
Of riches and of thrills
But on me fifteenth birthday
I paid my union dues
And they sent me deep into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Oh once I had a family
Sons to make you proud
They have gone and left me now
And I count the time out loud
For now, I am an old man
Just waiting for my turn
Till they take me back into the ground

Oh the winter wind can blow me colder
Oh the summer's heat can parch me dry
But I'll not leave here for a fortune
I shall never leave here till I die

Gossip, gossip, gossip, gossip


I heard it in the night, words that thoughtless speak
Like vultures swooping down below on the devil's radio
I hear it through the day, airwaves getting filled
With gossip broadcast to and fro on the devil's radio


Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah

He's in the clubs and bars and never turns it down
Talking about what he don't know on the devil's radio
He's in your TV set, won't give it a rest
That soul betraying so and so, the devil's radio


Gossip, gossip, gossip, gossip
Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah
Gossip, oh yeah, oh yeah, gossip


It's white and black like industrial waste
Pollution of the highest degree
You wonder why I don't hang out much
I wonder how you can't see


He's in the films and songs and on all your magazines
It's everywhere that you may go, the devil's radio


Oh yeah, gossip, gossip, oh yeah


Runs thick and fast, no one really sees
Quite what bad it can do
As it shapes you into something cold
Like an Eskimo igloo
None
At seventeen, she became the queen of Orleans
A peasant child guided by a vivid dream
She was cool before they knew what cool became
She cut her hair and cross-dressed in a dangerous age
She set a trend, a natural look was all the rage
Imagine if they'd had merchandise and poster sales
This bride of God, bigger than Elvis in her day
She had it all until they burned it all away


She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight 
Was she lonely after dark 
Did she pray for something more 
Did anybody sleep with Joan Of Arc 


She was small and more or less of common breed
But saint aside, no stranger to a woman's needs
No handsome knights, no random acts of chivalry
Her bed remained a simple place for her to sleep


She swung a sword
She rode a horse
She wore her armor for the Lord
But did she cry by candlelight 
Was she lonely after dark 
Did she pray for something more

Sling your hook in with him baby
He's a real sharp-shooter now
If he's out there hiding in the tall grass
Tell him I said he was a coward
This ain't any old western honey
It's the twentieth century now
But if he thinks he's some kind of tough cowboy
And he's hurt her then I want to know how


Did he shoot her with his compromise
Like a heart attack he can paralyse
Or did he hang her in a noose
On the telephone line
Did he shoot her with a 45
Did he leave his mark right between her eyes
Oh did he shoot that girl
That used to be mine

Tell him I'm ready any time he chooses
The pay-off for the things, for the things he's done
He ain't messing with no two-bit bandit
Armed with a couple of guns
If he wants to see it as a two reel movie
He's living in the head of someone else
But better take him down and dust him honey
I want to hear the truth for myself

I've seen a lot of women who haven't had much luck
I've seen you looking like you've been run down by a truck
That ain't nice to say sometimes I guess I'm really hard
But I'm gonna put buckshot in your pants if you step into my yard
When I watch the police come by and move you on
Well, I sometimes wonder what's beneath the mess you've become
Well, you may have been a pioneer in the trade of women's wear
But all you got was a mop-up job washing other people's stairs


I should tell 
I should tell 
I should tell 
Oh! 


I'm gonna tell the world you're a dirty little girl
Someone grab that bitch by the ears
Rub her down, scrub her back, and turn her inside out
'Cause I bet she, I bet she
I bet she, oh, I bet she hasn't had a bath in a year


Here's my own belief about all the dirty girls
That you have to clean the oyster to find the pearl
And like rags that belong to you I belong to myself
So don't show up around here till your social worker's helped



Ariel, listen to me
The human world, it's a mess
Life under the sea is better than anything they've got up there

Under the sea
Under the sea
Darling, it's better
Down where it's wetter
Take it from me
Upon the shore, they work all-day
Out in the sun, they slave away
While we devotin'
Full time to floatin'
Under the sea
Hahaha, y ah


Let it go, let it go
Can't hold it back anymore
L t it go, let it go
Turn away and slam the door
I don't care what they're going to say
Let the storm rage on
The cold never bothered me anyway

All my pictures seem to fade to black and white
I'm growing tired, and time stands still before me
Frozen here on the ladder of my life


Too late to stop myself from falling
I took a chance and changed your way of life
But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light


Don't let the sun go down on me 
Although I search myself, it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
Losing everything is like the sun going down on me


I can't find, oh, the right romantic line
But see me once and see the way I feel
Don't discard me just because you think I mean you harm
But these cuts I have, oh, they need love to help them heal

All my pictures, seem to fade to black and white

Don't let it, don't let it, don't let it
Oh, don't let the sun go down on me
You said
A fool would say it's over
But instead
The voice in my head was right


No more letting you down or messing around
All over the place, I'm just saying
You can be certain, you can move on
And you'll find someone, yeah I'm praying
She'll be better than me, I know I'll be pleased
I promise you that I'm not fake
Yeah, I know I'll see that setting you free was not a mistake


Don't look over your shoulder
Just keep walking away
We can breathe now, it's over
And erase all the pain


I bet
You smile just a little longer
So glad we made it

The voice in my head was right

If you wake up and don't want to smile
If it takes just a little while
Open your eyes and look at the day
You'll see things in a different way


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


Why not think about the times to come
And not about the things that you've done
If your life was bad to you
Just think what tomorrow will do


Don't stop thinking about tomorrow
Don't stop, it'll soon be here
It'll be here, better than before
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone


All I want is to see you smile
If it takes just a little while
I know you don't believe that it's true
I never meant any harm to you

She's a real ball-buster, don't trust her
She's in a most peculiar phase
You can rear end her, oh, it'll send her
She wants you, she'll have you her own way

Don't untie her, don't defy her
'Cause she'll bring you down to your knees
You can beat her, but don't mistreat her
Oh, don't believe that woman please


Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman, boys
'Cause she'll burn you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman
Don't trust that woman, boys
'Cause she'll hurt you
And turn you into little toys
Don't trust that woman, boys


She's a man-eater, oh, don't you cheat her
She'll cut you just to watch you bleed
A woman half crazy, oh, then again lazy
With an appetite to feed

I've written a song
That I hope is going to bring the world together


Put down your guns and bombs
And just make love forever 


He's come to heal the world
And make our nations calmer


I am the Austrian Jesus


He is the white Obama 


War's just based on hate and fear
Stop fighting North and South Korea


You're both basically Chinese


And he's Br no, dove of peace 
You are Br no, dove of peace 
You are Br no, dove of peace 
You are Br no, dove of peace 
NoneNoneNoneSteamboat waiting by the waterside
Sunlight shining on the morning tide
Got my ticket in my hand
Got some celebrating planned

Can't remember when I felt so fine
I've been waiting such a long long time
Just to hear those engines hum
Look out dreamboat here I come

And I say dream on dreamboat, let my love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
All aboard, make it fast
Thank the lord, I'm coming home at last

If you love me like you did before
Be there waiting on the distant shore
When my steamboat comes inside
Then I know we'll be alright

And I say dream on dreamboat, let your love light ride
Steam on steamboat to the other side
Turn the crank, change the gear
Raise the flag and let's get out of here

Feels so good to know that soon I'll see
You've been saving all your love for me
For honey if there's any doubt
Just be sure I don't find out

Look at you, could I have been so foolish and so green
A face that smiled at every passing scene
Look at you, you're lost behind the web of woven time
When each emotion pinball in your mind


Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn

But you and I have come so far
With a shaken faith
From the pain of a broken heart
Toward feeling great
Feel like life has just begun
No more singing duets for one
I hold your picture here beside the bed
You had a party raging in your head
Look at me, I look at you with vacancy and hurt
And here today all I can do is learn


Look at me, I'm happy now I see your face and smile
I was the judge and jury at your trial
Look at me, you know the road ahead will twist and turn
Now I have the time to stand and learn


I have this picture of me looking at you
Looking at me
And I would like to say
Goodbye sweet memory
I won't see you until Christmas
I breathe coal dust, I get blisters
But the foreman he don't worry
He say work, boy, there's no hurry
Don't that big red sun
Look a lot like fire
When you come out of the ground
After 48 hours


Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep
I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep


I was born on amen corner
I pound rock face, I get lonely
But my family, they go hungry
Sill the boss man he call us lazy
Don't the old blue heaven
Look a lot like your eyes
When you're blinded by the brightness
Of the Transvaal sky


Going down down down down down
Going down in Durban deep
Going down down down down down
There's no mercy in my sleep

I just hear that drill and hammer
I feel the killing heat
Going two miles down to the heart
Of Durban deep
NoneEvery time you turn around
You wear another face
Every time I look away
I find a hiding place

If you knew me like you knew him
You would know just how I feel
Slipping through someone's fingers
Falling under someone's wheels

It's easier to walk away
Better off to face the facts
When love holds you up for ransom
Walk away and don't look back

Never seen you looking back through
Smiling eyes and tears
Never knew you holding on to
Memories and fears

Just release me I can't take it
Can't you see a change has come
Strangled by infatuation
Buried under someone's thumb

It's easier to walk away
Cover and fade to black
When love scars and leaves you branded
Walk away and don't look back

This is the moment when
The gods expect me to beg for help
But I won't even try
I want nothing in the world
But myself to protect me
And I won't lie down, roll over, and die

All I have to do is forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic
Would have died

It's easy, it's easy

All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the contempt of the familiar cannot start
It's easy, it's easy

Until I think about him as he was when I last touched him
And how he would have been, were I to be with him today
Those very rare occasions don't let up, they keep on coming
All I've ever wanted and I'm throwing it away
It's easy, it's easy as life
This is the moment when the gods expect me
To beg for help but I won't even try
I want nothing in this world but myself to protect me
But I won't lie down, roll over and die

All I have to do is to forget how much I love him
All I have to do is put my longing to one side
Tell myself that love's an ever-changing situation
Passion would have cooled and all the magic would have died

It's easy, it's easy

Until I think about him as he was when I last saw him
And how he would have been were I to be with him today
Tender in his manner and myself consolation
All I ever wanted and I'm throwing it away

It's easy, it's easy as life

All I have to do is to pretend I never knew him
On those very rare occasions when he steals into my heart
Better to have lost him when the ties were barely binding
Better the content of the familiar kind of start

It's easy, it's easy

N o acho muito apropriado
Eu  ser assim santificado

At   o fim s  pra voc  e para mim!

Eu vejo que   t o f cil enganar

Take a look at me now and take a taste of the money
I'm not in it for the bread I'm in it for the gravy, honey
Step on the thin ice lightly
And check out the show twice nightly
'Cause I'm on the stage tonight
And if the price is right
I will amaze before the light I crave the light
Blinding white I need the light tonight

Take a look at me now and take a look at my billing
I'm not in it as an extra, I'm in it for the killing
Inflate my ego gently, tell them heaven sent me
'Cause I'm so expressive and I'm so obsessed with my ego
My ego and it's message
Oh inform the press, invite the guests
I need the press tonight

Do you remember acting out your youth
A Romeo resplendent on an orange case
Do you remember how I would recite
And how I'd blow my lines and hide my face

Well maybe it was childish, foolish, before schoolish
Immaturish, lose your coolish
But I had to grow and prove my ego

You had your grand illusion and wrestled with your fate
The winter of your discontent came twenty years too late
If it was love and I was there I've forgotten where it lives
We both stepped off a frozen rock onto a burning bridge
You came like an invasion all bells and whistles blowing
Reaping the rewards of the fable you'd been sowing
I saw you cross the landing and descending marble stairs
Like Caesar crossed the Rubicon you seemed to walk on air


Yea I've seen your movie
And I read it in your book
The truth just flew off every page
Your songs have all the hooks
You're seven wonders rolled in one
You shifted gear to cruise
Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes

Oh the bellboys are crying and moneys changing hands
Your cloak and dagger legacy's gone home to no man's land
The marquee lights are flickering your poster's fading fast
Your being here just melts away like ice cubes in a glass




Oh you came to town in headlines
And eight hundred dollar shoes
We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights

Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free

We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out, take others in

I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that
I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to love like that
I just want to be with you
Now and forever, peaceful, true

This may not be the moment
To tell you face to face
But I could wait forever
For the perfect time and place

We all lead such elaborate lives
Wild ambitions in our sights
How an affair of the heart survives
Days apart and hurried nights
Seems quite unbelievable to me

I don't want to live like that
Seems quite unbelievable to me
I don't want to love like that
I just want our time to be
Slower and gentler, wiser, free
We all live in extravagant times
Playing games we can't  all win
Unintended emotional crimes
Take some out take others in

Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to live like that
Too many choices tear us apart
I don't want to love like that
I just want to keep your heart
May this confession be the start

I know you'll give me courage
To face what I must face
With all these complications
In another time and place


We all lead such elaborate lives
We don't know whose words are true
An affair of the heart survives
All the pain this world can do


I'm so tired of all we're going through
I don't want to live like that


There's a fly in the window, a dog in the yard
And a year since I saw you
There's a trunk in the corner I keep all my letters
My bills and demands I keep too


Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine

Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line 
To pick the crop and get me hot on elderberry wine


Round a tree in the summer, a fire in the fall
Flat out when they couldn't stand
The bottle went round like a woman down south
Passed on from hand to hand


Well, I can't help thinking about the times
You were a wife of mine
You aimed to please me, cooked black-eyed peas-me
Made elderberry wine


Drunk all the time, feeling fine on elderberry wine
Those were the days, we'd lay in the haze
Forget depressive times
How can I ever get it together without a wife in line

Was build by the divinities by Gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
One thousand years ago
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
But all this was granted
For only one millenium
I know my legacy is to fulfill
My promise to all my people
Who have trusted me, the Gods
Will approve of us still

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

The mountains so high and waters deep
Are her disguise
Her secrets are safe from foreign hands
And eyes forever

Preserve El Dorado
The magnificent and golden
And I believe they will

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El DoradoOur glorious city
Was build by the divinities
By gods
Who saw fit to bestow
The gift of a paradise
Peaceful and harmonious upon
Us mere mortals below

And made El Dorado
The magnificent and golden

I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting
Losing who you are
And at the same time, something makes you whole


It's like that there's a music
Playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening
And then I disappear


And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open
Impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying
Flying like a bird
Like electricity
Electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free, I'm free

Can I just ask you, Billy
What does it feel like when you're dancing 


I can't really explain it
I haven't got the words
It's a feeling that you can't control
I suppose it's like forgetting, losing who you are
And at the same time something makes you whole
It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
And I'm listening, and I'm listening and then I disappear
And then I feel a change
Like a fire deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

It's a bit like being angry
It's a bit like being scared
Confused and all mixed up and mad as hell
It's like when you've been crying
And you're empty and you're full
I don't know what it is, it's hard to tell

It's like that there's a music playing in your ear
But the music is impossible, impossible to hear
But then I feel it move me
Like a burning deep inside
Something bursting me wide open impossible to hide
And suddenly I'm flying, flying like a bird
Like electricity, electricity
Sparks inside of me
And I'm free I'm free

All you need is love


You're being ridiculous


All you need is love

Just one night, give me just one night


There's no way 'cause you can't pay


In the name of love, one night in the name of love


You crazy fool, I won't give in to you


It's so easy, all you have to do is fall in love


Love hurts

Love is a many splendored thing
Love lifts us up where we belong
All you need is love!


Please, don't start that again


All you need is love

A girl has got to eat


All you need is love


Or she'll end up on the streets


All you need is love
Love is just a game
I was made for loving you, baby, you were made for loving me


The only way of loving me, baby, is to pay a lovely fee
Just one night, give me just one night


There's no way, 'cause you can't pay

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today
Staring all alone and your grace and style
Cut me to the bone with your razor blade smile
I watched you playing pool
It's all around the school that I love you
I love your gypsy hair and dark brown eyes
Always unprepared for your pointed replies
Cynical and lean
I lie awake and dream about you
If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away


Sitting in my room, I've got it bad
Crying for the moon, they think I'm mad
They say it isn't real but I know what I feel and I love you


If you only knew what I'm going through
Time and again I get ashamed to say your name
It's hard to grin and bear when you're standing there
My lips are dry, I catch your eye and look away

Where is the glory in this new me 
Where is the feeling of achievement
In the shadows of the evening 
Where is the satisfaction in your killing creed 

Who am I now, I don't know
I trust in my existence
And deal with your persistence
And somehow, some way, you set me free
And I don't think that I can take another night
Of these instincts that I fight
This overwhelming dread
Of feeling damned inside


Oh god help us, just look at you
Shrinking away from my point of view!
Showering me with your pious blam 
The gift that I gave is ex mpt from shame

Embrace it
Embrace it
It makes no sense without the strength to push your grief aside
This pleasure you deny

Embrace it
Embrace it


You seek my trust after your lies
Well, in this superficial splendor
The decades will seem endless
And will the drudgery of torment be my bride 


What lies of these are which you speak 
Are you so blinded by contrition
That you see, in my position
A failure to practice what I preach 

The church bells ring out morning glory
When summer bends to the winter's rage
Emily walks through the cemetery
Passed a dog in an unmarked grave
The old girl hobbles, nylons sagging
Talks to her sisters in the ground
I saw a lie in the mirror this morning
I heard a prophesy all around


And Emily they come and go
The shadows and the distant sounds
But Emily don't be afraid
When the weight of angels weighs you down




And though I've seen you near me
And sit here waiting the time
You'll, you'll be a child who's trying so hard to go
Oh Lord, may we help you grow gently to your prime


And that's why
Emma, oh Emma, how I pray we'll be right for you
Emma, come down from the far side of the sun
Come down from the far side of the sun
Come down from the far side of the sun
Won't you come down, won't you come down
From the sun...
What happened here as the New York sunset disappeared 
I found an empty garden among the flagstones there
Who lived here  He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now it all looks strange
It's funny how one insect can damage so much grain


And what's it for  This little empty garden by the brownstone door
And in the cracks along the sidewalk, nothin' grows no more
Who lived here  He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
And we are so amazed, we're crippled and we're dazed
A gardener like that one, no one can replace


And I've been knockin', but no one answers
And I've been knockin' most of the day
Oh, and I've been callin', "oh, hey, hey, Johnny
Can't you come out to play "


And through their tears
Some say he farmed his best in younger years
But he'd have said that roots grow stronger, if only he could hear
Who lived there  He must have been a gardener that cared a lot
Who weeded out the tears and grew a good crop
Now we pray for rain, and with every drop that falls
We hear, we hear your name

I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room
Those bars that look towards the sun
At night look towards the moon
Everyday the swallows play in the clouds of love
Make me wish that I had wings, take me high above


And I looked high, and saw that empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

At night I lay upon my bench and stare towards the stars
The cold night air comes creeping in and home seems, oh, so far
If only I could swing upon those twinkling dots above
I'd look down from the heavens upon the ones I love


And I looked high, and saw that empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place


And I looked high, and saw that empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place


Hey, the lucky locket hangs around your precious neck
Some luck I ever got with you and I wouldn't like to bet
That sooner or later you'll own just one half of this land
By shining your eyes on the wealth of every man


And I looked high, and saw that empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place

I'm not a rat to be spat on, locked up in this room

And I looked high, saw the empty sky
If I could only, I could only fly
I'd drift with them in endless space
But no man flies from this place, yeah

To sail away to half discovered places
To see the secrets so few eyes have seen
To see moments of enchantment on our faces
The moments when we smile and those in between


If I could leave this place then I'd be sailing
To corners of my land where there would be
Sweet southern winds of liberty prevailing
The beauty so majestic and so free


I will take you sailing, South.  You can be my guide

There'd be no ties of time and space to bind me


And no horizon I could not pursue


I'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind me


I'd put my faith and trusting in something new

A few more days and we'll be home in glory
Already they'll be getting out the flags
With Memphis high motive dormitory
Still I only see a lot of snags


For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
Brought beauty back to Egypt by the ton
Of this and every month, now I'm the flavor
And scheduled to do things I've never done


And why should I tell you this, a stranger I just met
A woman who in hours from now I'll certainly forget
Anonymous and undemanding, enchantment passing through
My secrets and my confidence are safe enough with you


My days out on the field are all but ended
They'll put me out to grass which means the throne
Bedecked and bejeweled alongside my intended
I feel as if my heart is set in stone


For just because I've triumphed as a slaver
Brought beauty back to Egypt by the ton
Of this and every month, I'm now the flavor
And scheduled to do things I've never done

There'd be no ties of time and space to bind us


And no horizon we could not pursue


We'd leave the world's misfortunes far behind us
And I will put my faith and trust in you
Had some good times
Jumping ship
And showing up on shore
Just pocket change to get us by
A little bit of grease to help us slide
Give us a nickel and take your mark
To squeeze under the door


Caught some big ones
Reeled em in
And hung em out to dry
From little fish to bigger things
A welcome push
An empty swing
Given the chance we'd stop to sing
And watch the world go by

And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America

It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America


Showed our roots from time to time
And used it to ignite
Our wilder side to get up through
To push and pull, and come unglued
Mixture of red wine and blues
That run right through our lives


And I tried to take my time
To get back up, hold on and climb
Into the arms, you'll always find me
In England and America

It seems good to hold, to not let go
The safety net still hangs real low
And if I fall it's good to know
There's England and America

Everyone should have their way
Even if it's only for a day
Something should be done
So that everyone can be the one
One time
Can't really blame the man
He does the best he can
Leaves it to the other guy
Maybe I'd do the same I don't know why
But something should be done
So everyone can be the one
One time
But you know it's hard in this world
For an easy soul
Giants of the world taking it all
Can't really blame the man
He does the best he can
Looking for an easy way
Maybe I'd do the same I'd do the same
Something should be done
So everyone can be the one
One time
But you know it's hard in this world
For a working girl
Giants of the world taking it all
Yeah it's hard in this world
For a working man
Giants of the world making a plan
But everyone should have their way
Even if it's only for a day
Everyone should have their way
Even if it's only for a day
Everyone should have their way

Ohhh...
From deep within the tomb, a gentle light still shone
Showing me my path as I ascended to the throne
Certain in my heart that ancient wars must cease
The lovers' deaths gave birth to a reign of peace

And their story
And my journey
And the lesson they provide
Draw their strength and inspiration
From a love that never died



He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine 

But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside 
I, N, V, U
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah 

Cold, cold heart 
You must be so confident thinking 
That I'm gonna give you my time 
My patience is waning, is this entertaining 
All I do is sit around and wait for better days 


As I get a little older 
I realize lif  is perspective
L t's start


What else can I do 
Is it sinful if you're blue
To cheer up the place 
What is wrong with dressing up in satin and lace 
Get some earrings, some mascara, heels and a fan
Pretty soon you will start to feel a different man

What the hell's wrong with expressing yourself 
Being who you want to be 
Will anybody die if you put on a dress 
Who the hell cares if your blusher's a mess 

Start a new fashion, buck all the trends
Emphasise integrity

Cos what the hell is wrong with expressing yourself
For wanting to be me 

BILLY
What the hell's wrong with wearing a dress 
Being who you wanna be 

MICHAEL
Who the hell is it you try to impress
All you have to do is learn to care less
Start a new fashion, buck all the trends

It s a true sign of a soldier
Taking care of the hearts around us
And the whole world loves a hero
A leader and a shoulder to cry on


That s what you are to me
Everyone around can see, yeah


When we re face to face, oh I
When the music plays, oh I
Standing side by side
Put the past behind us
No one can take your place
When we re face to face


You can measure the strength of a human
By the weight of the love around them
One sweet light in the darkness
Guided us all like a pilot


That s that you are to me
Everyone around believes, yeah

Is there anyone out there 
Or am I walking alone 
When I turned around and found that you'd gone
Before the first rain could fall


It seems every single time I was bleeding
Broken promises that never came true
Well, it ain't so long before the dawn
When the sun is gone, well, so are
Well, so are you


So what's it gonna take
To get you back in bed 
Gossips, frauds, or snakes
They're just our best fairweather friends 
Fairweather friends 


One day, when we're far away
From everything that hurts
Drink wine and screw is all we'll do
Every day 

Well I guess it would be nice, if I could touch your body
I know not everybody, has got a body like me baby 
But I gotta think twice, before I give my heart away
Cause I know all the games you play 
Cause I play them too baby

Oh but I need some time off, from that emotion
Time to pick my heart up off the floor
When our love comes down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
Showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith
 Faaaiith
 Faaaiith
 Faaaiith


Baby  baby  baby, uhh
I know you're askin me to stay
Say "Please, please, please don't go away
Because I'm givin you the blues  baby  baby  baby" uhh
You like me, but all them words you say
I can't help but think of yesterday
And another who tied me down to the leather board please

Before this weather, becomes that notion
'Fore you pick my heart up off the floor
When our loves come down, with that devotion
Gonna take a strong man baby, but I'm
Showin you that door, cause I gotta have - faaaiith
 Faaaiith
 Faaaiith
 Faaaiith

None
I read about how you're slow with the truth
Like any old Aesop's Fable
But when you're turtlesque, I'm a hare's breath
Into payment under the table
But some journalist got his mug shot kit
And his briefcase on his lap
But I'm tired of being linked with the K.G.B
And all that political crap


'Cause I've seen your fascist faces
On the cover of the national papers
Staring out in black and white
From the tall gray walls on the other side
When I see your fascist faces
Then I know I've had enough
Trying to trace it or erase it
Is it foolproof or a bluff


If the boy had been blessed he'd have been arrested
On a charge of wearing red shoes
But if your pants are blue you got nothing to lose
It'll make you a patriot through and through
Fat boys cry when ugly girls sing
About the way the world would be if they were thin
And ugly girls turn their heads when fat boys laugh
About the handsome kid next door who broke their heart
Who broke their heart
Broke their heart

And fat boys lie when ugly girls ask
About the size an apple pie looks through a magnifying glass
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

But it's the fat boy's world for an ugly girl
And ugly girls love that fat boy joy
Who needs the worries of a perfect world
Hear the early birds make that spring time come
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl
When a fat boy falls in love with an ugly girl

Fat boys dance when ugly girls shout
That a waltz is not the dance for the boy who's stout
And ugly girls dream at night when fat boys sleep
About the way the mirrors lie when beauty's only skin deep
Beauty's only skin deep
Skin deep

Don't close the shades, I'm scared of the darkness
I'm cold as a razor blade, inches from madness
Don't let me sleep here, they're all trying to kill me
I've seen the walls moving, they've all heard me screaming, screaming


Feed me
Feed my needs and then just leave me
Let me go back where you found me
Because I miss my basement
The sweet smell of new paint
The warmth and the comforts of home
So feed me
Give me my treatment and free me
My arms are so hungry so feed me


The room's so distorted, and filled with mad shadows
I feel like a carcass, white like a marrow bone
It all seems so long ago, I remember them laughing
I heard the ambulance scream, I saw the red light flashing, flashing




Feed meIt doesn't matter if you're large or small
Trapezeoid or short or tall
Even if you can't dance at all

All you really gotta do is shine

It doesn't matter if your life's a mess
The whole process will coalesce
Just try to evervesce
All you really gotta do is shine

Everyone is different
Its a natural state
Its a fact
Its plain to see

The world's grey enough
Without making it worse
We need individuality

'Cos what the hell is wrong
With expressing yourself 
What we need is in-di-vid-u-a-li-ty
Se   tampinha ou um varapau
Horizontal ou vertical
Mesmo que mande muito mal

Quem disse que   errado
Querer se expressar 
Vamos celebrar que cada um   um!
You, oh, you
Are still a beauty to behold
You been my muse
Every story that I've told
Oh, take me back some years
To when we were young without a fear


All along, you have been the song that I wanna hear


I been down the darkest alleys
Been to the bottom where the angels cry
Thought it had all been all for nothin'
Until I saw you at the finish line


Forgive me for the ways I've let ya down
Won't you give me another chance to make you proud 
Oh, flash forward twenty years
Forever keep me young and my conscience clear


All along, you have been the song that I wanna hear, ooh yeah, ah

I was one as you were one
And we were two so much in love forever
I loved the white socks that you wore
But you don't wear white socks no more, now you're a woman
I joked about your turned-up nose
And criticized your school girl clothes
But would I then have paced these roads to love you


For seasons come and seasons go
Bring forth the rain the sun and snow
Make Valerie a woman
And Valerie is lonely


No more to roam on the snow hills of Hienton
Undecided with the guardians of the older generation
A doormat was a sign of welcome
In the winter months to come
And in the summer laughing
Through the castle ruins we'd run
For the quadrangle sang to the sun
And the grace of our feeling
And the candle burned low as we talked of the future
Underneath the ceiling
There were tears in the sky
And the clouds in your eyes, they were just cover
For your thighs were the cushions
Of my love and yours for each other
I'm not out of danger
Where ever you may hide
There's still tears to be overcome
Wild dreams to ride
At night the sky is burning
And staring through the pains
I see all the past the future lies
Writing your name
On the roses
In the garden of love
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there, be there
Out of sight but not out of vision
I know what I can see
Maybe
Shadows all are falling on me
Keep on running to me
On the roses
In the garden of love
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there, be there, be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
What else can I do but to look through the sights
I aim to be there, to be there
I aim to be there, there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
All is reborn into dark into light
First thing in the morning I look through the sights
I aim to be there
First thing in the morning and last thing at night
Last thing at night
First thing in the morning I look through the sights
First thing
You're walkin', talkin', like a flame, baby
You're walkin', talkin', like a flame, baby
You're walkin', talkin', like a flame, baby

You're walkin', talkin', like a flame, baby



Never knew what my heart would be facin'
Guess I must have been blind
Sayin' goodbye to you baby
You baby, to, baby, you baby


Close my eyes at night, I can taste it
I'm right back in the fire
Where I once had you, baby, ooh baby
You say, "Don't ever leave me"
I say, "That's something I won't do"


I want you back in my arms
In the flames of paradise
The flames of paradise
I want you back in my arms
In the flames of paradise
The flames of paradise

Well Joey had a lover but he had to run for cover
When someone told a lie
Jo Jo his lover, he'd been cheating on him
Shouldn't he know why

He'd been messing around

She says
I'm flying across the ocean and I'm soaring
Back home to the place I was born
You know that I'm flying across the mountains
And valleys, back home to the one that I love so much

Now don't blame me for feeling homesick
I have been away for such a very long, long time
Lord, you know I served once in the county jail
And I feel strong for being hungry, tired and poor

On and on, guess I was born to run
With your buttons and bows
Yeah, with your buttons and bows
Yeah, with your buttons and bows
Yeah, with your buttons and bows
Yeah, with your buttons and bows

He's so sophisticated
In a critic's eye
He needs a change of habit
But then so do i
He's all Zeffirelli
In cool loose clothes
He needs to be rewired
He's plugged on overload


So crisp and new
Well it had to be
I guess he needs a change
From the likes of me
If he should lose some color
When he leaves the sun
I'm sure a little braggi
Wouldn't hurt no one


'cause when the fool's in fashion
He's attracting everyone
He'll be the head of your list
He'll be your dinner guest
If he's the center of attention
Looks like the fool's in fashion

My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird


My high-flying bird
Has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm


My high-flying, high-flying bird
My high-flying, high-flying bird
Sober in the morning light
Things look so much different to how they looked last night
As whispers circulate all day
Their backstage baby princess passed away
The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
Mm, in the foreign field of death


My high-flying bird
Has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weatherman of words
My high-flying bird
Has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weatherman of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird

Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave
Oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave


We have swept to glory
Egypt's mastery expands
From the Nile's northern delta
To the dry, dry southern sands

The more we find, the more we see
The more we come to learn
The more that we explore
The more we shall return


Oh, oh, oh
Fortune favors the brave


It's all worked out, my road is clear
The lines of latitude extend
Way beyond my wildest dreams
Toward some great triumphant end
It comes as no surprise
Your face filled with lies
Hovers all around me in this room

Clouds hung with my dismay
A hot bed where we lay
Your every kiss tasting like a tomb

If time becomes a judge
If my body holds a grudge
It's just because I needed sanctuary
Your skin under my nails
My curiosity that failed
To save myself for something that I need

I don't wanna bleed
Or bruise up black and blue
Do I deserve these things
All for wanting you  

Like some virgin with her cloth
I play the goddess coming through
Now I play the parting slave
All for wanting you

We do things 'cause we must
The law of love and lust
Comes together just like oil on flame

I looked into your eyes
You saw me naked for a while
How d'you like it in my little nest  

Who was really using who  
In here the scent of you
Stains the sheets with memory and lust
None
Me and you we're not that pretty
Me and you could use a lift
I'm out here on the corner crying
I got ribbons but I got no gift
Me and you we're all we've got
Me and you could be our curse
We've got bleeding hearts and flowers
You got strings but you got no purse


We're just freaks in love, saints above shine on our sweet life
Happy is the union of fools and freaks alike
And fearless are the idiots among the hawks and doves
We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love

There's a wonder in this weakness
It's so beautiful sometimes
Across the universe we're lightning
In the race we're a step behind
Me and you we're not for everyone
Me and you we're damaged goods
We're antique and unacceptable
And just misunderstood




We're on the outside looking in a couple of freaks in love
I've got a strong-willed someone to love me
Here off a highway in the way
Don't need to shout it
We're living here quietly
Away from the folks
Who just sleep all day
I lived the fast life, taking some chances
On my high horse everyone rode
All around were too many monkeys
Asleep at the wheel
And running the show

But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight


All my sweet sins  stayed in the city
I caved in and wandered into your heart
When least expected out of the heavens
The moonlight descended into the dark


But I'm free now, free and easy
Freedom's a breeze
Freedom's a time
Rolling over and over
And I want to be where you are tonight
Where you are tonight


Was your  to watch
In no heaven
Set back the clock you gave me
Your time
I'm living better now I'm free and easy
Freedom past I've left here high
I hope the day will be a lighter highway
For friends are found on every road
Can you ever think of any better way
For the lost and weary travellers to go

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

It seems to me a crime that we should age
These fragile times should never slip us by
A time you never can or shall erase
As friends together watch their childhood fly

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all right

Making friends for the world to see
Let the people know you got what you need
With a friend at hand you will see the light
If your friends are there then everything's all rightThere isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Still we are, have always been, will ever be as one

What is done hath been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy, the same sadness, each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue beckoning
The great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong 
Whose course is braver run 
All I know is all we had
Is over, said, and done
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

Friends never say goodbye
Friends never say goodbye



Well, good luck


Yeah, you too


Never say goodbye
If I say goodbye it'll grieve you
Denver means the whole world to you
Girl it breaks me up just to leave you
But I got things that I gotta do
Got to take my guitar
With one break I'm a star


Girl I'll love you forever more
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A
Girl I know that you'll make me stay
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A


There's a whole new life to be led there
That's the place that I gotta be
Guys are making mountains of bread there
Reckon it could happen to me
Lots of guys make the grade
Just one break and I may
And I'll bring it on home


Girl I'll love you forever more
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A
Girl I know that you'll make me stay
But today I've got to make my way
From Denver to L.A






The roses in the window box have tilted to one side
Everything about this house was born to grow and die
Oh, it doesn't seem a year ago to this very day
You said, "I'm sorry, honey, if I don't change the pace
I can't face another day"


And love lies bleedin' in my hands
Oh, it kills me to think of you with another man
I was playin' rock and roll, and you were just a fan
But my guitar couldn't hold you, so I split the band
Love lies bleedin' in my hands


I wonder if those changes have left a scar on you
Like all the burnin' hoops of fire that you and I passed through
You're a bluebird on a telegraph line, I hope you're happy now
Well, if the wind of change comes down your way, girl
You'll make it back somehow

The roses in the window box
Have tilted to one side
Everything about this house

He talks a lot but never talks to anyone at all
He shakes his fists at busses and old posters on the walls
He knows someone who knew something about J.F.K
But his friends are just the shadows in the halls and alleyways
The rumbling frozen pipes whisper secrets in the night
In the coffee grounds, his fingers sketch a portrait of his wife
She knew the legal eagle when his wings swept through the stars
Before he shut the furnace down and sealed away his heart


It's Gauguin gone Hollywood again
A sleeping giant inside a rabbit's skin
Tahitian doors beyond the painted veil
Another simple mind adrift
Like Gauguin going Hollywood again
The day lacks color, days are duller than a butter knife
Rusty water running through hands out of touch with life
A man of independent means, he'd have us all believe
A soul who throws his wings away before he goes to sleep


If only for a moment, the dead weight were alive
An invitation for the flame to shine a light inside
Illuminating darkness, giving him release
Then someday in his trash can we'll find a masterpiece

When it's springtime down in Georgia
It's winter time up in Maine
You can go from snow to sunshine
If you board a southbound train
You get used to taking orders
But it's sometimes kind of rough
I got everything that a man could need
But it still isn't quite enough


Taking about oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel my life is rolling on
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I'm gone

When it's nighttime down in Georgia
It's daytime in L.A
Where they never seem to do much
But they sure got lots to say
The times are changing down in Georgia
Though not always for the best
Give me thirty five good acres lord
And let progress take the rest




Oh Georgia take me to your Southlands
I sometimes feel that life has passed me by
Oh Georgia lead me through your heartlands
I need to see them one more time before I die Music by elton john
Never released

None
Uh, hit 'em with a little ghetto gospel


Those who wish to follow me 
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

If I could recollect before my hood days
I'd sit and reminisce, thinkin' of bliss and the good days 
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays, things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth, 'cause the truth look strange
And for me, it's reversed
We left 'em a world that's cursed, and it hurts 
 Cause any day, they'll push the button
And all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary  The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes, see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time to hear me, maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white,  cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined
My ghetto gospel

Those who wish to follow me 
I welcome with my hands
And the red sun sinks at last
Into the hills of gold
And peace to this young warrior
Without the sound of guns

You've been crying, and I'm crazy about you
I've been lying, and hanging you up, because
I'm deep on the inside, but flash on the outside
I am the thunder, and you are my lightning
Give me the love, baby, give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, give me the key to your heart
Months of watching, and hours of hoping
That you'd want me, when you see me again
For I am an eagle, but my wings are all tied up
You got the power to fly me again
You've been trying to build walls all around you
But you're lying, because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying to capture that feeling
But you're chasing what you've never believed in
Months of watching
And hours of hoping
That you'd want me
When you see me again
For I am an eagle
But my wings are all tied up
You got the power
To fly me again

So, give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love, baby
Give me the key to your heart
Give me the love
Give me the key to your heart


You've been trying
To build walls all around you
But you're lying
Because I've already been through
And I've seen you trying
To capture that feeling
But you're chasing
What you've never believed in




Tell me you love me
Tell me you need me

I may not always love you


But long as there are stars above you


You never need to doubt it


I'll make you so sure about it

God only knows what I'd be without you


If you should ever leave me


Though life would still go on believe me


The world could show nothing to me


So what good would living do me

It's a long long journey
When you're on your own
It's a long long way to travel
When you're all alone
So be careful and you'll find
That you're sure to make good time
'Cause your home
Is the best place you can go


I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home

Don't you try and stop me
I made up my mind
I have been to many places
Where they treated me unkind
So be careful and you'll find
That you'r  sure to make good time
'Caus  your home
Is the best place that I know


I'm going home, going home
I'm going home, I'm going home
I'm feeling tired, sad and all alone
I'm going home, going home


It's a long late evening
And not far to go
You have traveled many miles
But it's nice to know
You're careful, you'll find
That you always make good time
Good time
To the best place you can go

It's so hard to say goodbye
When there's nothing left to give
When this house is just a hill of bones
Where you and I once lived
If we put it back together
By the skin of our teeth
You'd still pull it all apart
Bit by bit, piece by piece
And I'll go it alone
Call this house my home
Build it up again with someone new
Build it brick by brick
Till I find a girl that fits
This home's a whole lot better without you
There's no passion alive
When you count your phony schemes
And the cars you drive to buy your friends
They don't ever come back clean
If the cards on the table
Always turn up spades
The cards that always cheat the hearts
The spades you play just dug my grave
Luther left at first light Friday morning
Little Dan and Becky wave good-bye
They're gonna have to share the wait together
Idle hands will see a good fire slowly die


Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, hope springs eternal
When flags and bullets start to fly

April's come and the air smells fresh with rain
They watched his shadow fade around the bend
He's headed for a different kind of thunder
And the stunned surprise in the eyes of dying men


Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, time passes slowly
When flags and bullets start to fly


The old black rooster sang in death down that dirt road
His steps in bold, his man of fancy free
I pray we see him alive and well in the forehead
In that Godforsaken place in Tennessee


Gone to Shiloh for the Union
Shoulder to shoulder, side by side
Gone to Shiloh, men stand united
When flags and bullets start to fly


After all this, if we should prevail
Heaven help the South
When Sherman comes their wayAnd now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon
I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste awayAnd now that it's all over
The birds can nest again
I'll only snow when the sun comes out
I'll shine only when it starts to rain

And if you want a drink
Just squeeze my hand
And wine will flow into the land
And feed my lambs

For I am a mirror
I can reflect the moon
I will write songs for you
I'll be your silver spoon

I'm sorry I took your time
I am the poem that doesn't rhyme
Just turn back a page
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
I'll waste away
Am lie
Goodbye, girl
Am lie
I give you your wings
Fly so free
And join the angel choir, girl
And teach them to sing

Am lie
Beats me, girl
Why you had to bid this planet adieu
Let me be the first to say
Merci, girl
That means, "Thank you!"
We're an ocean of rowboats
You decided to save
Lifting us to the shoreline
Like a wave

When your harp and your halo hit the sky
Look down, we'll be waving goodbye!

Am lie
Our flashlight
How we see when the power blows
Shine on me like a thousand Zippos
No! A zillion Zippos!

Half-blind a blizzard
On a slippery slope
You are up at the summit
With a rope

When your harp and your halo hit the sky
Look down, we'll be waving goodbye!
NoneGoodbye England's Rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
You called out to our country
And you whispered to those in pain
Now you belong to heaven
And the stars spell out your name

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will
Loveliness we've lost
These empty days without your smile
This torch we'll always carry
For our nation's golden child
And even though we try
The truth brings us to tears
All our words cannot express
The joy you brought us through the years

And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never fading with the sunset
When the rain set in
And your footsteps will always fall here
Along England's greenest hills
Your candle's burned out long before
Your legend ever will

Goodbye England's rose
May you ever grow in our hearts
You were the grace that placed itself
Where lives were torn apart
Goodbye England's rose
From a country lost without your soul
Who'll miss the wings of your compassion
More than you'll ever know

Say goodbye to loneliness
Say goodbye to Marlon Brando
Say goodbye to latitudes
And the confusion that surrounds you

Say goodbye to misery
Say goodbye to the morning news
Say goodbye to prime time
And the fools that choose to view


Say goodbye to Wendy
Say goodbye to Rhonda
Say goodbye to the Beach Boys
From the Palisades to Kona


Say goodbye to Glasnost
Say goodbye to Malathion
Say goodbye to the clowns in congress
And the belt around Orion

Say goodbye to the tabloids
Say goodbye to diet soda
Say goodbye to new age music
From the Capa to the Coda
Goodbye, Norma Jean, ich habe dich nie gekannt
Als du gegangen bist, da war ich noch ein
Kind
Und jetzt frag ich den Pf rtner vom Filmatelier
Ob er mir sagen kann, wo ich deine Spuren find'

Oh Norma Jean, du hast gelebt wie eine Kerze im rauen Wind
Deine zarte Haut verbrannte im hei en Studiolicht
Du warst zu schwach f r den Sturm, der auf den
Hollywoodbergen weht
Ich h tte dich ger ttet, doch ich kam viel zu
Sp t
Die R klamelettern, hoch oben  ber der Filmstadt
Haben schon viele erschlagen, die st rker war'n als du
Ach du h ttest aus Stahl sein soll'n
Doch du warst nur aus Fleisch und Blut
Selbst im Tod lie en sie dir keine Ruh
Und weiter wurdest zu gejagt von den geilen Pressehunden
Und die Schlagzeile war: Man hat dich nackt gefunden
Ja du warst zu schwach f r den Sturm, der auf den Hollywoodbergen weht
Ich h tte dich gerettet, doch ich kam viel zu sp t
Ich h tt' dich gern gerettet, doch ich kam leider viel zu sp t

Goodbye, Norma Jean, ich habe dich oft geseh'n
Vielleicht erinnerst du dich, ich sa  in Reihe zehn
Der Junge mit den Pickeln, f r den du immer noch viel mehr bist
Als irgendein Sexobjekt, das man einmal benutzt und vergisst

Oh Norma Jean, du hast gelebt wie 'ne Kerze im rauen Wind
Deine zarte Haut verbrannte im hei en Studiolicht
Du warst zu schwach f r den Orkan, der auf den Hollywoodbergen weht
Ich h tte dich gerettet, doch ich kam viel zu sp t
So gern h tt ich dich gerettet, doch ich kam viel zu sp tNone
When are you gonna come down 
When are you going to land 
I should have stayed on the farm
I should've listened to my old man


You cannot hold me forever
I didn't sign up with you
I'm not a present for your friends to open
This girl's too young to be singing
The blues

So goodbye yellow brick road
Where the dogs of society howl
You can't plant me in your penthouse
I'm going back to my plough
Back to the howlin' old owl in the woods
Hunting the horny black toad
Oh I've finally decided my future lies
Beyond the yellow brick road


What do you think you'll do then 
They'll probably shoot down your plane
It'll take you a couple vodka and tonics
To set you on your feet again
Maybe you'll get a replacement
There's plenty like me to be found
Mongrels who ain't got a penny
Sniffing for tidbits like you
On the ground, oh

Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Wake up Mr. West, Mr. West
Mr. Fresh, Mister, by himself he's so impressed
I mean damn, did you even see the test 
You got D's, muthafucka D's, Rosie Perez
And yer ass barely passed any and every class
Looking at every ass, cheated on every test
I guess, this is my dissertation
Homie this shit is basic, welcome to Graduation
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!
Good morning!

Good morning world, it's a brand new day
I'm packing my bags and I'm going away
I'm moving my legs and my city tired bones
I got to get away from the busy man's phones


Got to make a move where the living is wild and free
If you want to get happy, then people, come along with me
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu

Run along boy, set a place for me
I'm getting so tired of the company
I'm getting  looks from the big white man
I got to get away just as fast as I can




Good morning freedom, got to break away
Got to break away, got to break away
Good morning freedom, it's another day
It's another day, it's another day
Good morning freedom
A fee, fa, fou, fa, fa, fa, fa, fouu


 is the same old game
A city tired living is the game to play
Loving thy neighbor is the real life thing
There's only one way to get the people to sing


I thought I knew
Now I know
Way alone
Now I know


Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night

Thought I knew
Now I know
Way alone
Now I know


Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night


Tonight, why not approach with less defiance 
Do we have to fight again 
Turn out the light
Tonight


Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
Turn around and say, "Good morning" to the night
On and on
On and on


She broke my heart 
That's something that only unworthy souls do
They said goodbye 
An introduction for a perfect love to grow


Let's stop thinking about the past

So sad when you find out your love has found a new
She made me cry 
But life has love in store for us that's oh so sweet

So that love can go on and on
Let's stop thinking about the past

Don't get wet, please keep dry
Think about the people who made you cry

I believe in the     of every man
Where     take notice of    
If you see the road turning straight ahead
Got to run on down, never never be afraid

I know a man, well he's six feet tall
Buckskin jacket    
From the Boston town, yeah, is educated well
And he     about himself
Behind the curtain, upon the shelf
Lived a man    
Behind his his eyes, behind his smile
What's going on, anybody in the world can tell
Jeg har aldrig regnet hy ner for vigtige

Mellem dem og min kl gt og kultur


Jeg ved jeres  ndlige kr fter
H nger slapt som et vortesvins hud
Men pr v nu trods alt at h r' efter
De guldkorn jeg her slipper ud
Jeg ved I er dumme kujoner

Men det her g lder konger og troner
Selv hos jer m  den sag tr nge ind
G r jer klar til at ta' mod et tilbud
G r jer klar til den store sentation

Hold jer til mig
Og I skal aldrig mere sulte igen
Ja, hurra, s dan, l nge leve kongen
L nge leve kongen!

N r jeg bli'r konge vil mit folk frit ku' ta' for sig af retterne. For en hy nes mave bli'r aldrig fuld

I can hound you if I need to
Sip your brandy from a crystal shoe
In the corner
In the corner
While the others climb reaching dizzy heights
The world's in front of me in black and white
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line
I'd have a cardiac if I had such luck
Ooh! Lucky losers, lucky losers landing on skid row
Landing on skid row
While the Diamond Jims and the Kings road pimps
Breathe heavy in their brand new clothes
I'm on the bottom line
I'm on the bottom line

And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain, no regret, no regret
When the line's been signed, you're someone else
Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest


Shake a hand if you have to
Trust in us and we will love you anyway, anyway
Don't leave us stranded in the jungle
With fifty percent that's hard to handle
Ain't that so 
Ain't that so 


And I gotta get a meal ticket
To survive, you need a meal ticket
To stay alive, you need a meal ticket
Feel no pain, no pain

Do yourself a favor, the meal ticket does the rest

Grandma, do you really not remember about granddad 


'Course I do!
How could I forget your granddad, Billy
We were married thirty-three year


So what was like like

He was a complete . . . Bastard!


I hated the sod - for thirty-three year
We should never have married of that I'm quite clear
He spent the housekeeping money on whiskey and beer
And never lifted a finger
Times were hard, but the swine rolled back pissed
So we'd fight and he'd swing and he rarely missed
So I'd clobber the sod when he couldn't resist:
Asleep, you can't lift a finger

But we'd go dancing
And he'd hold me tight
He was air, He was water, He was breath, He was light
And he would hold me there, with all his might
And it was bliss for an hour or so
But then they called time to go
And in the morning we were sober



Why's it never light on my lawn 
Why does it rain and never say, "Good day" to the newborn 
On the big screen, they showed us a sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one


And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise 
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal


I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so worn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye


And tell me, grey seal
How does it feel to be so wise 
To see through eyes that only see what's real
Tell me, grey seal
Why's it never light on my lawn
Why does it rain and never say good-day to the new-born
On the big screen they showed us a sun
Why's it never light on my lawn

Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was re-born before all life could die
The Phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the Phoenix bird can fly then so can I

As I lay dreaming in my bed
Across the great divide
I thought I heard the trawler boats
Returning on the tide
And in this vision of my home
The shingle beach did ring
I saw the lights along the pier
That made my senses sing


Oh, oh, Grimsby, a thousand delights
Couldn't match the sweet sights
Of my Grimsby
Oh, England you're fair
But there's none to compare
With my Grimsby


Through nights of mad youth
I have loved every sluice in your harbor
And in your wild sands from boyhood to man
Strangers have found themselves fathers


Take me back you rustic town
I miss your magic charm
Just to smell your candy floss
Or drink in the Skinners Arms 
No Cordon Bleu can match the beauty
Of your pies and peas
I want to ride your fairground
Take air along the quay

Yeah I looked at my watch and it said a quarter to five
The headlines screamed that I was still alive
I couldn't understand it, I thought I died last night
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds


When along came a se orita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, he was so macho

And he said grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
We no like to with the gringo fight
But there might be a death in Mexico tonight
If you can't grow some funk of your own, amigo
Grow some funk of your own
Take my advice, take the next flight
And grow your funk, grow your funk at home
I mean, the situation was ridiculous


Well, I looked for support from the rest of my friends
For their vanishing trick they get ten out of ten
I knelt to pray just to see if He would comprehend
Oh, I dreamed I'd been in a border town
In a little cantina that the boys had found
I was desperate to dance just to dig the local sounds


When along came a se orita
She looked so good that I had to meet her
I was ready to approach her with my English charm
When her brass knuckled boyfriend grabbed me by the arm
Oh, and it hurt so much

Hand it over
Reach across the line
Let's talk about it, tell me one more time
What is it you want
What you think you'll find
Inside of this old heart of mine
Come on out
Cause you want to play
The rain went east, come to roll away
Here you went to choose and you're gonna stay
So I knew that's the price I pay


Can't you tell the deal's been done
Won't you let me love you
I don't see no smoking gun
I'm not up here to judge you
What do you see when you look at me
Tell the man to measure
Am I the lover you'd like my love
Or just some guilty pleasure


I roamed around
Looking for a clue
Searched the world it's what I used to do
Where I went
What I went though
A bit too hard to find a way to you
I can't move so
Never really could
Sing a song that you understood
It's what you do when you think you should
Surrender like you knew you always would
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master
His watery eyes had washed all the hills with his laughter
And the seasons can change all the light from the grey to the dim
But the light in his eyes will see no more so bright
As the sheep that he locked in the pen

There's four feet of ground in front of the barn
That's sun baked and rain soaked and part of the farm
But now it lies empty so cold and so bare
Gulliver's gone but his memory lies there
By passing the doors of his life was a stage I remember
And in later years he would cease to bare teeth to a stranger
For sentiment touched him as cyclamen holds him
And later men came from the town
Who said clear the child this won't take a while
And Gulliver's gone with the dawn
Gulliver's gone to the final command of his master

Gulliver's gone but his memory lies thereYou win again, you gypsy heart
I count the days that we're apart
I sleep alone when you're away
No sense in saying I wish you'd stay
It's all the same, you never change
You come and go just like the rain
I pray each day that you are gone
This time it won't be so long

Your gypsy heart will never find
Any arms as warm as mine
And gypsy when we meet again
I'll play my part
And wrap you up inside my arms
Oh you gypsy heart
Your gypsy heart can always call
When your back's against the wall
And darling then I'll just pretend
Right from the start
You never left me on my own oh you gypsy heart
I pray each day that you are gone
This time oh it won't be so long

When I was a young warthog
How you feelin'  It's an emotional story
He found his aroma lacked a certain appeal
He could clear the Savannah after every meal
I'm a sensitive soul although I seem thick-skinned
And it hurt that my friends never stood downwind
I was here for you, and I resent that
And, oh, the shame!
Yes, he was ashamed
I thought of changing my name!

And I got downhearted
Every time that I farted... are you gonna stop me 
No, I'm not. You disgust me!

Sometimes I think I'm going crazy
Staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out

I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men
How I've struggled for my money
Sweated blood to get us by, yeah

Well I'm tired of it honey
Think I'm gonna have to leave here for a while
All you hear are hard luck stories
And the ways I look at life
And the way I think the world treats me
And the way that I treat my wife
I never seem to look at you
And see that somewhere underneath

A pair of tired eyes are crying out
Well you know I work hard all day long
Let me kiss you once with meaning
Just to kill this nagging doubt

Well you don't deny I do you proud
And you expect me to be tired
You say there's no future in our lives
While I persist I'm putting out the fire

All you hear are hard luck stories
Just a few well chosen words
'Cause you're still the woman of a working man
You've got the heart of a working girl
Sometimes I think I'm going crazy, staring at the same four walls
Waiting for the working day to end
Then I get home so wasted, worn out, I curse at you and tell you
How I've done the work of ten to fifteen men

Hello, baby, hello
Haven't seen your face for a while
Have you quit doing time for me
Or are you still the same spoiled child 
Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you thought to go
Am I the only man you ever had
Or am I just the last surviving friend
That you know 


Harmony and me, we're pretty good company
Looking for an island in our boat upon the sea
Harmony, gee, I really love you and I wanna love you forever
And dream of never, never, never leaving harmony


Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow
In any case I set my own pace by stealing the show
Say hello, hello
Ah!

Have you heard the dogs at night
Somewhere on the hill 
Chasing some poor criminal
And I guess they're out to kill
Oh, there must be shackles on his feet
And mother in his eyes
Stumbling through the devil-dark
With the hound pack in full cry


Have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change 
Don't you hear him any more 
Praying, "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

Now have you ever seen the white teeth gleam
While you lie on a cold damp ground 
You're taking in the face of a rifle butt
While the wardens hold you down
And you've never seen a friend in years
Oh, it turns your heart to stone
You jump the walls and the dogs run free
And the grave's gonna be your home


Oh, have mercy on the criminal
Who is running from the law
Are you blind to the winds of change 
Don't you hear him any more 
Praying, "Lord, you gotta help me
I am never gonna sin again
Just take these chains from around my legs
Ooh, sweet Jesus, I'll be your friend"

Luau!
If you're hungry for a hunk of fat and juicy meat
Eat my buddy Pumbaa here because he is a treat
Come on down and dine
On this tasty swine
All you have to do is get in line
Are you achin'...


Yum, yum, yum!

...for some bacon 


Yum, yum, yum!


He's a big pig


Yum, yum!


You could be a big pig too
Oy!
I never dreamed I could cry so hard
That ain't like a man
I could fly like a bird some days
Had a place where I could land
I could have sworn we were all locked in
Ain't that what you said 
I never knew it could hurt so bad
When the power of love is dead


But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You gotta wade into the water
You gotta learn to live again

And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands


I never knew love like poison
That burned like a fire
All I ever wanted was a reason
To drown in your eyes
I never knew sleep so restless
Empty arms so cold
That's not the way it's supposed to be
It ain't the spell that I was sold


But giving into the nighttime
Ain't no cure for the pain
You got to wade into the water
You got to learn to live again


And reach out for her healing hands
Reach out for her healing hands
There's a light, where the darkness ends
Touch me now and let me see again
Rock me now in your gentle healing hands

Well I'm running away
From this house on the hill
There's a devil inside
Sitting on the windowsill
And it's a wild Friday night
And I'm all on my own
I knocked on every door in town
There ain't one little girl that's home


And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome
Looking for a girl
But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh, it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache, heartache all over the world

He's got lipstick on his collar
She's got fishnets on her legs
I'm at home and I've got nothing
Just a cold and aching head
There must be something dirty
Just blame it on the magazines
Don't read that trash, it'll drive you crazy
'cause the cops invade your dreams


And everybody's got a date
And the ones that ain't are tired
What the hell do you do on a weekend, honey
When your heart's on fire
And you can go from Tokyo to Rome

But it looks to me like the weekend means
Heartache all over the world
Girls, girls, girls
Have pity on me
Oh, it looks to me like the weekend means
There's heartache, heartache all over the world


Oh, oh
Well, here I am
Take me
Look in my eyes
You'll see the soul
Underneath my celebrity skin
I'm not afraid
To open up wider
Please be my guest and come on in
You'll feel right at home
Inside my song
Shelter from the stormy weather
Body and soul, body and soul
Blood will bring it all together
I'm going to lift it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
I'm driven by what I desire
I'm going to live it up
And lift it off
Higher
Don't depend on luck
Be driven by what you desire
Thank you

I've got a good by-line, they all know my name
The queen of the sly line, I feed on your fame
But I got my heart in the right place, it's all in the game
If you're doing fine boy, you got my vote
But step out of line boy and I'll go for your throat
Because I got my heart in the right place, so give me a quote


I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You'll open your heart like a friend
I'll make up some answers you won't recognise
The you I create with my pen
But my heart's in the right place now and again


My heart's in the right place, know what I mean
My heart's in the right place on page seventeen


I'll ask you some questions, I'll tell you some lies
You don't understand, but you will
I'll make up some answers, cut you down to size
Then I move in for the kill
But my heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place
My heart's in the right place, it's part of the skill
Heaven help the child who never had a home
Heaven help the girl who walks the street alone
Heaven help the roses if the bombs begin to fall
Please, Heaven help us all

Heaven help the black man if he struggles one more day
Heaven help the white man if he turns his back away
Heaven help the man who kicks the man who has to crawl
Heaven help us all

Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us, Lord, hear our call, hear our soul

Heaven help the boy who won't reach twenty-one
Heaven help the man who gave that boy a gun
Heaven help the people with their backs against the wall
Heaven help us all

Heaven help us all, heaven help us all, help us all
Heaven help us, hear our call with this world

Now I lay me down before I go to sleep
In a troubled world, I pray the Lord to keep, keep hatred from the mighty
And the mighty from the small
Heaven help us all

Shakey wake up thirsty from a night in the bar
And snake hips Joe is Mr. Cool
Out on the boulevard
The pimp from the Jack of Diamonds
Just got another Jane Doe
She just got off the last bus from Monteceto
Sailor boys find trouble in the alien state
It's one on one from Las Palmas to the Golden Gate
Fly boys on the corner waiting for a ride
For twenty bucks he'll pull the cork on the man inside


Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Judy's in the jump seat and Jody's in the bucket
Billy likes to drive and Jackie's just high
And Cindy thinks we're all gonna commit suicide
Because we're rolling in heavy traffic
Yeah we're rolling in heavy traffic


Mack he's got his Marlboros tucked up in his sleeve
He's shacked up in his basement making P.C.P
He used to shake the french fries
Down on 12th and Maine
And now he stays up nights on apple juice and cocaine

I couldn't take it anymore son
It was tearing me apart
We're lost, we're finished man, we're through
I need to give the kid a future
I need to look him in the eye
Believe me son I'd do the same for you


But you can't give in now Dad
We've all been out a year
I can never talk to you again
You can't do this to me Dad
You can't do it to yourself
He's just a kid, he's only just a bairn

He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give
And no one else can give what I can give
He could go and he could shine
Not just stay here counting time
Son we've got the chance to let him live
Yes, we've got the chance to let him live


This isn't about us Dad
It's not about the kid
It's all of us, it's everybody's chance
It's everybody's future
It's everybody's past
It's not about a bairn who wants to dance
It's about our history
It's about our rights
Think about the sacrifice we've made
It's what you always taught us since I was a lad
Please, Dad, don't let that passion fade


He could be a star for all we know
We don't know how far he can go
And no one else can give what I can give
And no one else can give what I can give

Just like a broken marriage, when two people just don't care
Like when the cupboard is empty or there's no food in the Frigidaire


I'm a page from the end of the story
No closer to my hope and glory
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind


How come it gets so disturbing, when two ships pass in the storm
Who knows how high the crow flies, who knows where this refugee was born



And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind


You don't deserve that treatment, I can't pretend I was that nice
I'm no E ticket ride to Disneyland, I'm no cushy first class flight
I'm a day behind your restless wings
You, you rather have the wealth of kings
Me, I'd rather be on the heels of the wind


And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
The fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind


And just for the sake of all these reasons
Rains wash out the fires within
Fires that help to keep you moving
Just a kick away from the heels of the wind

Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing 

Ducking up and down
All these crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool

Just when you think
You're a chain with just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool


Hello, hello
My my my, what have we here 
What a surprise
What a surprise

Hello, Hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello

Feet are feeling light
Head on out to see the sights
Ain't life a many splendored thing 
Ducking up and down
All those crazy sights and sounds
Bounce around like puppets on a string
Never gonna find, anything to change my mind
Famous last lines of a fool


Just when you think
You're chain is just one link
Something comes to tip you off your stool


Hello, hello
Hello, hello
My my, what have we here 
What a surprise, What a surprise!
Hello, hello
Hello, hello
I'm not alone it's good to know
Someone's out there to say hello
Hello!

Take my hand and lead the way
Out of the darkness and into the light of the day
And take me somewhere I'll be safe
Carry my lifeless body away from the pain


Cos I know what I've been missing
And I know that I should try
But there's hope in this admission
And there's freedom in your eyes

And we cry away


I'm sick and tired of being afraid
If I cry any more then my tears will wash me away
But when I hear you call my name
I whisper the word that I never thought I'd ever say


And I hope to God you'll listen
And you'll keep me safe from harm
Cos I found what I was missing
When I fell into your arms


And we cry away


I can feel the darkness coming
And I'm afraid of myself
Call my name and I'll come running
Cos I just need some help
I can feel the darkness coming
And I'm afraid of myself
Call my name and I'll come running
Cos I just need some help
If I'm gonna tread the way, well I hope to do it right
Yes, I'm a true believer in the light
If I go wrong and lose my way, while I'm wandering in the night
May I come through to tell you it's all right 


You gotta help me, Jesus
Get me back on the ground 
You gotta help me, Jesus
Get me back where I'm bound 
With your love 
Mm... oh, with your love
With your love 
Mm... Lordy, with your love


You've had it your way long enough
But you didn't get much done
Did you believe you'd change things with a gun 
Haven't you seen there's no way out
If the least of us can't come
We all got a friend who loves us, everyone 


You gotta help me, Jesus
Get me back on the ground 
You gotta help me, Jesus
Get me back where I'm bound 
With your love 
Mm... with your love
With your love 
Mm... Lordy, with your love

Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting
Like an out-of-tune guitar
Ooh, she got a-Hercules on her side
And Diana in her eyes
Some men like the Chinese life
Some men kneel and pray
Ooh, well, I like women and I like wine
And I've always liked it that way
Always liked it that way







Well, I can't dig it, the way she tease
That old tough-man routine up her sleeves
Livin' and a-lovin', kissin' and a-huggin'
Livin' and a-lovin' with a cat named Hercules
A cat named Hercules


Oh, but it hurts like hell to see my girl
Messin' with a muscle boy
No Superman's gonna ruin my plans
Playin' with my toys
Rich man sweatin' in a sauna bath
Poor boy scrubbin' in a tub
Me, I stay gritty up to my ears
Washin' in a bucket of mud
Washin' in a bucket of mud

Ooh, I got a busted wing and a hornet sting

NoneNoneNoneLike I said baby
If you go astray
Well then go on
Go your own sweet way
I thought you knew by now
You do just what you please
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

How many times
Have you gone before
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more
Never had to wait
Like I waited for you
And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time

When you're gone
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to make me cry
To make me cry

So if you're gonna leave me
Never to come back
Break it to me gently
Or my world will crack
So be sure to let me know
That I'll never say
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Here's to the next time
Like I said baby
If you go astray
Well then, go on
Go your sweet way
I thought you knew by now
You do just as you please


And here's to the next time
And here's to the next time


How many times
Have you gone before 
And how many times
Have I forgiven you once more 
You never had to wait
Just like I waited for you


And here's to the next time
Here's to the next time


When you're gon 
The time drags by
I wish you'd learn
Not to mak  me cry
To make me cry

It's a constant struggle getting up that hill
There's a change of guard every day
When you're clinging onto a driftwood boat
You pray a great white whale might come your way
No freeway traffic in the frozen North
Just a chain link fence full of birds
And when the harpoon's loaded in the cannon bay
You'll be rolling through the pages lost for words


Hey Ahab can you tell me where
I can catch a ride out of here
Hey Ahab hoist that sail
You gotta stand up straight
When you ride that whale

In a crumbling city we were trapped for days
With a broken sun above the clouds
Caught like Jonah forty fathams down
And a sign on the wall saying, "Hope Allowed"
All the cryptic symbols carved on bone
A far cry from a tattooed rose
And when the boys in the rigging catch the wind

We'll all weigh anchor and it's westward ho

Hey armadillo what you doing in the garden
Slumbering and spherical, you're always hanging around
Leather on the outside but a delicate interior
Very like a lot of human beings I have found

Hey armadillo I can't tell which way you're facing
Maybe that's a good thing, maybe you don't even know
No one's gonna bother you if they can't find your front end
There again I guess you find your love life rather slow

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo

Hey armadillo what you doing in the desert
Is a life of burrowing the answer to it all
What I would give to leave my problems six feet underground
And always be the perfect shape to be, and have, a ball

In the armadillo circle
In that armour-plated set
The philosophy is simple
What you see ain't what you get
In the armadillo culture
In that well-protected creed
A solid hide to hide in
Is the only thing you need
Hey armadillo
Hey armadilloMusic by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1982

He would recount the stories he had learned so well
Fourteen years is a long time in one cell
When the pipe is passed the opium does its rounds
Papa legba sitting pretty in a chicken little town

His textured skin, like leather in the sun
Fingers beating hard upon a native drum
He picks his teeth with a splintered back rib bone
Papa legba bears his fangs and lays alone

Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Hey papa legba, no one gonna bother you
Hey papa legba, hoo-boo-be-do
Shake papa legba, no one's gonna bother you tonight, alright

He was free to dance alone where the spirits run
His almond eyes would twinkle on a hundred sons
His champagne toast and white meat on a spit
Papa legba's drunken with a smile upon his lips
Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Je caressais le temps, et jouais de la vie
Comme on joue de l'amour, et je vivais la nuit
Sans compter sur mes jours, qui fuyaient dans le temps
J'ai fait tant de projets, qui sont rest s en l'air
J'ai fond  tant d'espoirs, qui se sont envol s
Que je reste perdu, ne sachant o  aller
Les yeux cherchant le ciel, mais le c ur mis en terre


Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Je gaspillais le temps, en croyant l'arr ter
Et pour le retenir, m me le devancer
Je n'ai fait que courir, et me suis essouffl 
Ignorant le pass , conjuguant au futur
Je pr c dais de moi toute conversation
Et donnais mon avis, que je voulais le bon
Pour critiquer le monde, avec d sinvolture

Hier encore, j'avais vingt ans
Mais j'ai perdu mon temps   faire des folies
Qui ne me laissent au fond rien, rien de vraiment pr cis
Que quelques rides au front, et la peur de l'ennui
Car mes amours sont mortes, avant que d'exister
Mes amis sont partis, et ne reviendront pas
Par ma faute j'ai fait le vide autour de moi
Et j'ai g ch  ma vie, et mes jeunes ann es


Du meilleur et du pire, en jetant le meilleur
J'ai fig  mes sourires, et j'ai glac  mes pleurs
O  sont-ils   pr sent...
  pr sent mes vingt ans  
Mes vingt ans  
And I'm gonna be high 
I'm a rocket man, I'm a rocket man, hey!
And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh
I'm a rocket man 


Atlanta by my side
Different land for my kind 
Spend ol' bands for my pa 
Spend ol' bands for my mother 
Got a plan for my brother 
Chanel bag for my lover 
Fuck them ol' niggas, they ol' suckas 
They tellin' on one another 
I want a train, let's run a train 
If she wan' bang, then let her bang 
He said he bleeding, where the stain  
My bitch at the top of food chains 
They local, I don't even know they name 
I been fresh since a kid, ain't never plain
I just picked up a bag in Rotterdam
I'ma whip out the MAC and pop ya brain

I do what I want and shawty can't 
I do what I feel and shawty cannot
I'm diggin', I digg and shawty layin' 
And all of the bitches say they digg that 
From Maine way to Spain 
All I got is a chicken for the thots 
I take off like a plane-

And I'm gonna be high
Like a rocket man, hey, like a rocket man, he-ey!
And I'm gonna be hi-i-i-i-i-i-igh
I'm a rocket man 
High as a plane! From Spain to Maine, you know what I'm sayin'  Damn


On a private order 
I'm a rocket launcher 
It gotta be the pride of something 
I walked out Magic stumbling 
I stumble upon a mil' 
I stumble upon a million five
I spent a fortune all on double seals
If I tell you the numbers you'll probably cry 
If I tell you you fake then you'll probably die
These days if he say that he hit then he probably lyin'

If you say you got wings and some fish then you probably fried 
Got my karats out of Bonnie & Clyde 
She let me back in like she never cried
She let me back in like I never lied
I look like a cat with 11 lives
I really kick shit you can ask a fly 
I'm steady chasing like I'm never tired
I'm living scary like a haunted house
Lil mama sexy, I got butterflies, hey

You wore a little cross of gold around your neck
I saw it as you flew between my reason
Like a raven in the night time when you left
I wear a chain upon my wrist that bears no name
You touched it and you wore it
And you kept it in your pillow all the same


My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird


The white walls of your dressing room are stained in scarlet red
You bled upon the cold stone like a young man
In the foreign field of death
Wouldn't it be wonderful is all I heard you say
You never closed your eyes at night and learned to love daylight
Instead you moved away


My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird has flown from out my arms
I thought myself her keeper
She thought I meant her harm
She thought I was the archer
A weather man of words
But I could never shoot down
My high-flying bird
NoneSitting here on Christmas Eve with a brandy in my hand
Oh I've had a few too many and it's getting hard to stand
I keep hearing noises from my fireplace
I must be going crazy or the brandy's won the race

And I keep hearing ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise, surprise
The bearded weirdy's just arrived

Ho ho ho, guess who's here
Your fat and jolly friend draws near
Ho ho ho, surprise surprise
The bearded wierdy's just arrived

On my roof there's snorting sounds, and bells inside my head
My vision's blurred with colour, and all he sees is red
There's a pair of large sized wellies coming down my flue
And the smell of burning rubber, oh is filling up the room






I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands 

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today, oh


Hold me closer
Hold me closer 
Hold me closer

There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels, baby
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh

Boston at last, and the plane's touching down
Our hostess is handing the hot towels around
From a terminal gate to a black limousine
It's a ten minute ride to the Holiday Inn


Boredom's a pastime that one soon acquired
Where you get to the stage where you're not even tired
Kicking your heels till the time comes around
To pick up your bags and head out of town


Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn


Slow down, Joe, I'm a rock and roll man
I've twiddled my thumbs in a dozen odd bands
And you ain't seen nothing till you've been
In a motel, baby, like the Holiday Inn


Oh, I don't even know if it's Cleveland or Maine
With the buildings as big and rooms just the same
And the TV don't work and the French fries are cold
And the room service closed about an hour agoNoneNone
Yeah, as a kid growin up in Brooklyn, my pops was a DJ
He had a bunch of records - funk, jazz, rhythm and blues, soul
There was this one gospel record I liked like, like

Like holy moly, I might get some religion and leave you holy holy
Yeah, this rhyme is so fat it's roly poly
I give you intimate details so you can get to know me
These corporate rappers like "Why this dude pickin on me "
You rap your way to the top, but now it's gettin lonely
Kids is hungry and you lookin like a steak from Nick & Toni's
But don't nobody want your jewels, cause your shit is phony
Say word  Your shit is real  Damn, your shit is corny
My rhymes turn a new page like Mark Foley
And touch kids like when Larry Clark gave the part to Chloe
Rest in peace to Harold Hunter, the greatest from New York
Started out skatin for Zoo York
Word hangin out at The Gavin, I was very lucky
To talk to Rash' once I got past Derek Dudley
Got him on "Respiration", that's pre-Badu
Bet you Garnett Reid got a Matt Doo tattoo
Sometimes I feel like I'm drownin I gotta tread water
Head above the water I always remember Headquarters
Heads up, eyes open, I got my mind focused
I find hope inside a line, my rhymes define opus
Sometimes hopeless people, fill my thoughts with evil
My record so hard it broke the needle
At the Mixtape Awards niggas act like they don't give a fuck though
And disrespect the legacy of Justo
What the blood claat  No, let the blood flow
You ain't come to pay your respect, then what you come fo' 
Too many good niggas die, it's like a stop loss
Hood niggas ghetto like fried wings and hot sauce
How you hard  The cops lettin 50 shots off
Baby Jay-Z's with the knockoff Scott Storch beat
You are not Short, you are not Katt
You're not a player or a pimp, money stop that
Learn to master your speech and be eloquent
Rappers keep peddlin sweets, the beats weaker than gelatin
We used to kick up dust, now we settlin
Rest in peace to Dilla, Weldon, we can't forget you
Professor X and, Proof we miss you, word
Rest in peace to Shaka, twenty one gun salute
In the air like "BLAKA BLAKA BLAKA"
You're still here cause you're livin through me
You're like a gift God has given to me
Uh, uh, uh, what 
I m countin' on a memory to get me outta here
I m waitin' for the fog around this spooky little town to clear
All this time I ve spent bein' someone else s friend
Just one more time, for old time s sake, I d like to go back home again


The world had seven wonders once upon a time
It s sure enough the favoured nations aided their decline
And all around me, I ve seen times like it was back when
But like back then, I d say amen if I could get back home again

If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I d never left, I d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again


Could've been a jailbreak and the spotlight hittin' me
Or was I just some nightclub singer, back in 1963
In the old part of Valencia on the coast of Spain
Never tirin' once of hearin' songs about goin' home again


If I could go back home, if I could go back home
If I d never left, I d never have known
We all dream of leavin', but wind up in the end
Spendin' all our time tryin' to get back home again


If I could go back home, if I could go back home

Spending all our time trying to get back home againDo you want to drive to ride mount on your pony
Loosen up my tie to help me breathe
Insisting that I pay my alimony
Each and every day is the same old scene

Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
Come on do the roll, do the roll with me
I said honey, I said honey
I said honey, I said honey
Come on do the honey roll with me

Well I want to say that I'm your mister funky
Singing this song is taking up your time
I did the donkey now I'm your funky monkey
Sing it children, sing it on your mindWhen I look back, boy, I must have been green
Bopping in the country, fishing in a stream
Looking for an answer, trying to find a sign
Until I saw your city lights, honey, I was blind

They said, get back, honky cat
Better get back to the woods
Well, I quit those days and my redneck ways
And, oh, the change is gonna do me good

You better get back, honky cat
Living in the city ain't where it's at
It's like trying to find gold in a silver mine
It's like trying to drink whiskey from a bottle of wine
Well, I read some books, and I read some magazines
About those high-class ladies down in New Orleans
And all the folks back home, well, said I was a fool
They said, oh, believe in the Lord is the golden rule

NoneNoneShe's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis
She tried to take me upstairs for a ride
She tried to heave me right across her shoulder
And I just can't seem to drink you off my mind

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

I laid a divorcee here in New York City
I had to put up some kind of a fight
The lady then she covered me in roses
She blew my nose and then she blew my mind

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk blues

She's a honky tonk women
Give me, give me, give me the honky tonk bluesNone
You say that all you want are the simple things
Long walks on lonely beaches, guitars with nylon strings
But underneath you'd rather leap through a hoop of fire
You shy away from lips that want, that want to kiss you
Tongue-tied on formal evenings, wealth don't impress you
But if you ask me you like the heat in a hoop of fire


And it's hard to read just how you feel or what your dreams desire
Your pulse that races when I'm close reads like a hoop of fire 

No late nights making love in secret places
You feel pressure all around you, mistrust in strangers faces
But don't pretend you wouldn't spend some time in a hoop of fire 

I'm just sitting counting all the cobwebs
And wondering just when you'll come along
You said that you'd be here an hour ago
But an hour ago is hours ago from then

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hour glass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do
Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true
And I've got nothing to doI'm just sitting counting all the cobwebs
And wondering just when you'll come along
You said that you'd be here an hour ago
But an hour ago is hours ago from then

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

Light another cigarette, watch the burning glow
Catching spiders in my hand, and then I let them go
Imagine pictures on the wall, watch the insects where they crawl
They don't care about you and I've nothing to do
No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by

Maybe the bus didn't get there on time
Maybe the train doesn't run on that line for some reason
And she might not come
Because she doesn't want to see you again
No no no, that can't be true
And I've got nothing to do

No, and I don't know what to do
I'm drawing crazy patterns on my shoe
And the sand in the hourglass slips on by
This is my house
This is where I live
That is the winter
Those are the trees
I can hear them breathe


This is my bed
This is where I sleep
That was the dark
Those are my dreams
They belong to me


This is my floor
This is where I lie
This is a square room
That was a bright light
These are not my eyes
What is my soul
Where is my tired heart
That is the question
Where is the answer
Inside my house
And I sit by the window
And I wish I was rain
I want to fall from the sky
I want to get wet all over again
Because this my house
It belongs to me
Inside my head
It's all that's left
This is my house
I hear tell some playboy has kidnapped your heart
With his plane and his plans for games after dark
Just a pain in his pocket, and the price of a room
Where the second hand sheets smell of stale perfume

If there's sharks in the water, don't swim where it's deep
For the taste of success can be bitter and sweet
It could be alright that I act like a child
But you'll be the loser when the jokers run wild

You're just playing the game, but the stakes are too high
What will you do when the chips start to fly
When the deck's stacked against you, and the living gets hard
Oh it's four walls of madness in this house of cards
Common you call me, but I know there's time
In a handful of diamonds, a heart's hard to find
And your house of cards starts weighing you down
Your nights become restless when the clubs start to poundDancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
1:30... 2:30
Dancin' my love
How could we still be dancin'
After all these years
How could we still be laughin'
After all those tears 

How could we still be friendly
After slammin' those doors
How could we still be livin'
After all those wars
Hey, everybody
Help to make this feelin' right
Oh, won't you help to make this feelin' right

How could we still be rockin'
After all those times
How could we still be rolling'
And still be makin' rhymes 

How could we still make music
After MTV
How could we still get things crankin'
And see what we can be

Hey, everybody
Help to make this feelin' right
Oh, won't you help to make this feelin' right

Dancin', dancin'
Dance the night away
Dance the night away
1:30... 2:30
Dancin' my love

How could we still be dancin'
After all these years
How could we still be laughin'
After all those tears
How could we tell the difference
Between right and wrong
Confusion reigned for so long
But now we found our song
James Taylor---How I Know You

Music by Elton John

I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction which possibly explains

How I know you
How I know you
Before that fateful morning my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the king, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell

How I know you
How I know you

Enough of reminiscence, and such happy memories
The reason why I know you well is really none of these
It's just you reek of royalty, you ooze uncommon grace
I'd know you were a princess, in any time and place

Yes I know you
How I know you
Yes I know you
How I know you
I grew up in your hometown, at least began to grow
I hadn't got to my first shave before the body blow
Egyptians in the courtyard, my family in chains
You witnessed our abduction, which possibly explains
How I know you
How I know you

Before that fateful morning, my family enjoyed
A privileged existence, for my father was employed
As advisor to the King, no less, which surely rings a bell
For as you are his daughter, you probably can tell
How I know you
Yes, I know you

You know too much, and what you say is better left unknown
And now I'm just a slave like you, our lives our not our own


I never have abandoned, and nor I think could you
That spark of hope for freedom no terror can subdue


My only hope is silence, you've never seen my face


No, you remain a princess in any time or place


You don't know me


Yes, I know you


You don't know me


How I know you
How I know you
There is a time, there is a place
When love should conquer all
The rest of life is pushed aside
As truth and reason fall
But only if that selfishness
Can lead to something good
I thought I knew you, princess
But I never understood

I don't know you
I don't know youYou make me feel like I don't need another
Come on baby let's pull back the covers
And do our best to help one another
Find out how much fun we can get into life
You got me scorched where I'd forgotten there was fire
You got me foxed and you know I ain't a liar
Come on baby, help me try and
Find out how much fun we can get into life
Sit back, relax, we've got all night
Feel the groove, nice and smooth
Let's get it right
I make the situate, maybe I
I know a good place to land, so come on let's fly
You make me feel like I don't need another
Come on baby let's pull back the covers
And do our best to help one another
Find out how much fun we can get into life
You got me higher than I've been since I started
Couldn't want you more if I tried any harder
We could fall in love but I gotta
Find out how much fun we could get into life We got what's what
Let's make it work
Feel the beat in your seat
Don't make it jerk
Settle down, look around, there ain't no rush
There's a whole load of possibilities
Just the two of us
You make me feel like I don't need another
Come on baby let's pull back the covers
And do our best to help one another
Find out how much fun we can get into lifeNone
She chose the soft center
And took it to bed with her mother
And the ideal confusion
Was just an illusion
To gain further news of her brother
And the comfort of mother
Was just an appeal for protection
For the cat from next door
Was found later at four
In surgical dissection


And I don't want to be
The son of any freak
Who for a chocolate center
Can take you off the street
For soon they'll plough the desert
And God knows where I'll be
Collecting submarine numbers
On the main street of the sea


The Vicar is thicker
And I just can't see through to him
For his cardinal sings
A collection of hymns
And a collection of coins is made after
And who wrote the Bible
Was it Judas or Pilate
Well one cleans his hands
While the other one hangs
But still I continue to stand
You could never know what it's like
Your blood like winter freezes just like ice
And there's a cold lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win
Well look at me, I'm coming back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standing you just fade away
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
Once I never could hope to win
You starting down the road leaving me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus you'd be a clown by now
You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
Don't you know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I'm still standing yeah yeah yeah
I've been beaming aboard her for a light year
From a strange craft
She's got a subtle touch on the silver key
To a clockwork heart


I am your robot 
I am your robot man
I am your robot 
I am your robot man

You went and flipped the switch and turned me positive
When I was negative
I've been stumbling around like a metal man
On the graveyard shift




I am your robot and I'm programmed to love you
My serial number is 44357


I am your robotI can't go on living without you, oh no
I once said I could go on without your love
I would be strong but things have changed and heaven's above
I know that I need you more than I did before

I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no my love
I can't go on living without you, oh no

If you could see the state I'm in you'd never know
That it was the same old me that told you to go
I've never been happy since I walked out on you

You know that I've missed you more than anything at all
If there's any way to get you back I'll try it
I won't deny it, I'm lonely for you girlNone
I can't keep this from you
I've held it in so long
It's time to tell the truth
Keeping it from you is wrong
I can't keep this from you
It's so simple I'm afraid
When I tell you how I feel
You'll just laugh and call me crazy


And I can't keep
This love a secret
And I don't want
To go on longing
I just want a chance for me to prove
My love and I can't keep this from you


I can't keep this from you
It's hard to breathe in here
I just seem to act the fool
Every time I feel you near
I can't keep this from you
No matter what you say
Anything is better now
Than going through my life this way

Take me for granted, I think that I could stand it
After all these rough seas, left me reckless and abandoned
Say the spirits willing, chance a new beginning
Break down the cold front, give me peace and understanding


And you wait, and you wonder
Will she still beat the drum and bring the thunder 
Will she still be the star and see me through 
Because I can't steer my heart clear of you

No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you


Make me your penance, show me your innocence
Everything is history, from the aching to the pleasure
We enjoy the torture, the slow pain that it taught us
Everything gets twisted, let me burn or bring me water




No I can't steer my heart clear of you
It's the way it's been, ever since you sailed
Out of a storm and into view, and should I drift away
The compass holds the clue, you control the weather
And I can't steer my heart clear of you
You control the weather, and I can't steer my heart clear of you
And every time I get to thinking
Every thought of you I want to shout aloud
Then I think about the love I have inside me
How you brought what's inside out
Now love's made it to the outside
I want to tell the world of everything I've found
Somehow your love released a spring wound up inside me
You turned my living upside down


And I can't tell the bottom from the top
Am I standing on my head or on my heels
Is it cloudy, is it bright
Is it day or is it night
Am I wrong or am I right
And is it real


Tell me where you learned the magic
The spell you used the day you made me fall
Maybe now I know that love is no illusion
I'm upside down but ten feet tall


NoneThis house that I live in has no reason
This house that I sleep in has no purpose
It has a bed and a few old chairs
Three flights up, two flights of stairs
But it has no reason

Then someone shot through the tyre swing
The dogs barked and bayed in the winter and spring
And the ivy that hung now sadly clings
To a dying season

And I cry at night when the lights go out
And the green eyes fuse and the full moon shouts
From road maps and red lines to lipstick lies
And when the lights go out it's tought to survive

This man holds a hand that shows a tremble
This man that I live in bears his faults
He has a heart and a well worn soul
Ten years a slave to Rock And Roll
But he has to tremble

For the yellow grass on the sun burnt lawn
Sleeps in her seeds from the sunset to dawn
And just like your love that's come and gone
It goes on breathing
He was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him
To the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I want to watch them

'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
Oh he's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before


He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized in the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend
That it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lame suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share


'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
He was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
Oh he's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before
Oh, he was a light star
Tripping on a high wire
Bulldog stubborn
Born uneven
A classless creature
A man for all seasons
But don't bet them
They can't take him to the very bottom
Because they made him
And they'll waste him
And I don't believe
That I wanna watch them


'Cause the fifties shifted out of gear
Mmm, he was an idol then
Now he's an idol here
But his face has changed
He's not the same no more
And I have to say
That I like the way his music sounded before


He was tight-assed
Walking on broken glass
Highly prized
In the wallet size
The number one crush
In a schoolgirl's eyes
But don't pretend that it won't end
In the depth of your despair
You went from lam  suits
Right down to tennis shoes
To peanuts
From the lion's share 

I got feet sticking out of my shoes
I got heat more than I can use
I got love, I got all I need
I got soles that are wearing thin
I got holes where the rain gets in
I got you and that's enough for me


I don't care, I don't care 
I don't care, long as I got your love

Clothes that are falling apart
I got a car that refuses to start
I got love, I do the best I can
I got bills piling up in the hall
I got paint peeling off the wall
I got you, I'm a happy man

I don't feel like dancin'
When the old Joanna plays
My heart could take a chance
But my two feet can't find a way
You'd think that I could muster up a little soft-shoe gentle sway
But I don't feel like dancin'
No sir, no dancin' today

Wake up in the morning with a head like 'what ya done '
This used to be the life but I don't need another one
You like cuttin' nothing and carrying on, you wear them gowns
So how come I feel so lonely when you're up getting down 

So I'll play along when I hear that special song
I'm gonna be the one who gets it right
You better move when you're swayin' round the room
Look's like magic's only ours tonight

But I don't feel like dancin'

I don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Even if I find nothin' better to do
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
Why'd you pick a tune when I'm not in the mood 
Don't feel like dancin', dancin'
I'd rather be home with the one in the bed 'til dawn with you


Cities come and cities go just like the old empires
When all you do is change your clothes and call that versatile
You got so many colours it'd make a blind man so confused
So why can't I keep up when you're the only thing I'd lose 


So I'll just pretend that I know which way to bend
And I'm gonna tell the whole world that you're mine
Just please understand when I see you clap your hands
If you stick around, I'm sure that I'll be fine

I've always said that one's enough to love
Now I hear you're braggin' one is not enough
Well, somethin' tells me you're not satisfied
You got plans to make me one of four or five


I guess this kind of thing's just in your blood
But you won't catch me carvin' up my love
I ain't no puzzle piece that needs to fit
If it takes more than me, let's a-call it quits

'Cause I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad
But I don't wanna go on with you like that


Oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh
Whoa-oh
Oh yeah


It gets so hard sometimes to understand
This vicious circle's gettin' outta hand
Don't need an extra eye to see
That the fire spreads a-faster in a breeze


And I don't wanna go on with you like that
Don't wanna be a feather in your cap
I just wanna tell you, honey, I ain't mad

Without you I no longer swim upstream
Where are you when I try to fill the spaces in between
The red letter days and all the pain
And while I remain shipwrecked everything has changed
And I fall apart
With this threat of indecision
Hanging in my heart
This house can get so lonely
When the day grows dark
And it seems to be the night time
When I fall apart
Can't you tell the shadows no longer comfort me
I don't feel the need to cling to anyone I see
This fool's suffered gladly each and every day
I don't wish to reconsider, I wish they'd stay away
I've no care to count the stares that pity me
I'll wash your hurt away just you wait and see
For every rose you give her I'll give her three
But in the meantime I'll just wish that she was me
Like a corn in a field I cut you down
I threw the last punch too hard
After years of going steady, well I thought that it was time
To throw in my hand for a new set of cards
And I can't take you dancing out on the weekend
I figured we'd painted too much of this town
And I tried not to look as I walked to my wagon
And I knew then I had lost what should have been found
I knew then I had lost what should have been found

And I feel like a bullet in the gun of Robert Ford
I'm low as a paid assassin is
You know I'm cold as a hired sword
I'm so ashamed can't we patch it up
You know I can't think straight no more
You make me feel like a bullet honey in the gun of Robert Ford


Like a child when his toy's been stepped on
That's how it all seemed to me
I burst the bubble that both of us lived in
And I'm damned if I'll ever get rid of this guilt that I feel
And if looks could kill then I'd be a dead man
Your friends and mine don't call no more
Hell, I thought it was best but now I feel branded
Breaking up's sometimes like breaking the law 

NoneI thought I could be
Someone other than me
Playing the game
Always the same
Through it all now I see
'Cause love welcomes arms
Who finally fall
You gave me all that I need
When you said 'i need you'
We'll sit together and work it all out
We'll love together and work it all out
And if it rains well I'll stand up and shout
Let's sit together and work it all out

I finally found
Both feet on the ground
We're like colours through to the end
Take the hand of a friend
We'll sit together and work it all out
We'll love together and work it all out
And if it rains well I'll stand up and shout
Let's sit together and work it all out
Torn from their families
Mothers go hungry
To feed their children
But children go hungry
There's so many big men
They're out making millions
When poverty's profits
Just blame the children


If there's a God in heaven
What's He waiting for 
If He can't hear the children
Then He must see the war
But it seems to me
That He leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land

Dying for causes
They don't understand
We've been taking their futures
Right out of their hands
They need the handouts
To hold back the tears
There's so many crying
But so few that hear


If there's a God in heaven
What's He waiting for 
If He can't hear the children
Then He must see the war
But it seems to me
That He leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land




If there's a God in heaven
What's He waiting for 
If He can't hear the children
Then He must see the war
But it seems to me
That He leads his lambs
To the slaughter house
And not the promised land

Oh, oh


I don't know what to say
I don't know where the light shines
It's a gray dawn risin' on a green hill
And there's so much behind us
I don't know where we go
I sure feel there's something out there
There's a great awakening and a new morning
And your spirit's pounding loud and clear


If the river can bend
I'll find you waiting
Home at last from the wild sea
All the twists and turns
We've made together
All the boats you rocked, with your harmony


If the river can bend

If the river can bend

If the river can bend

Ha, if the river can bend
If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you
If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you

Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus side-shows
And laughter in the rain
You stay with the full moon
You search for the stars
Thank god it's heaven
Here we both are
If you were me
And I was you
If you had to play my part out
What would you do
Two crazy stories
Two different views
If you were me
And I was you

If you were me
And I was you
What kind of crazy things
Would I have to do
Who likes to party
Who stays at home
If you were me
And I was you

Never like strangers
Though never the same
Two circus sideshows
And laughter in the rain
You stayed with the full moon
You searched for the stars
Thank God in His heaven
Here we both are

Though the moon may catch the sun, if she bides her time
I'll not go to anyone, if you won't be mine
I said, if you won't be mine, my love
If you won't be mine
I'll not go to anyone, if you won't be mine


Though the sun may touch the land, if the weather's fine
I'll not be holding any hand, if you won't be mine
I said, if you won't be mine, my love
If you won't be mine
I'll not be holding any hand, if you won't be mine

Though the stars may touch the sky, looking for to shine
I'll keep my love hid till I die, if you won't be mine
I said, if you won't be min , my love
If you won't be mine
I'll keep my lov  hid till I die, if you won't be mineNever thought I'd miss you
When you said goodbye
Never thought I'd see the day
That I break down and cry
Won't you come on back to me
Back where you belong

'Cause I get a little bit lonely baby
Lonely and blue missing you
I get a little bit lonely baby
If you ever come back, gonna be true
Oh I know I hurt you
Couldn't you forgive
For I know without you
It's impossible to live
I want you back in my arms again
Back where you belong

Come on baby
Let's forgive and forget
And even though things are bad
I'm gonna get you yetNoneDon't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I can honestly say
That things will only get better

And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide

And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands should be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues

Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man, Mary Mary

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me, I could honestly say

Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever, I simply love you
More than I love life itself

Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love itselfOoh, I bet you're wondering how I knew
About you're plans to make me blue
With some other guy that you knew before
Between the two of us guys
You know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
I know that a man ain't supposed to cry
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losing you would end my life you see
'Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love somebody else
Instead I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
People say believe half of what you see
Son, and none of what you hear
I can't help being confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For the other guy you loved before
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer would you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
Oh and I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeahNone
I'm gonna be a mighty king, so enemies beware!


Well, I've never seen a king of beasts with quite so little hair


I'm gonna be the main event, like no king was before
I'm brushing up on looking down, I'm working on my roar!
Thus far, a rather... uninspiring thing

Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
You've rather a long way to go, young master, if you think...

Out of service, out of Africa - I wouldn't hang about... aagh!
This child is getting wildly out of wing


Oh, I just can't wait to be king!
Way behind the water hole
A little down the line 
The jungle and the plains and peaks
Are scheduled to be mine 

Gonna be the ruler of everything around 
From the grandest of the mountains
To the humble common ground 
My reign will be a super awesome thing
Oh, I just can't wait to be king

I'm gonna be a noble king
Scrupulously fair
I only need a little time
Perhaps a little hair

I'm gonna be the main event

How have I come to this 
How did I slip and fall 
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all 

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of shift in the stars
But I know the truth and it haunts me
It's flown just a little too far

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
It's flown just a little too far

Why do I want him still 
Why when there's nothing there 
How to go on with the rest of my life
To pretend I don't care

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
I closed my eyes to so much for so long
And I no longer can
How have I come to this 
How did I slip and fall 
How did I throw half a lifetime away
Without any thought at all 

This should've been my time
It's over, it never began
Facing a world, for once not on my side
I simply turned and ran

I try to blame it on fortune
Some kind of twist in my fate
But I know the truth and it haunts me
I learned it a little too late

I know the truth and it mocks me
I know the truth and it shocks me
I learned it a little too late

People have faith in me
I think I once did too
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
I'll see the bad times through

This should have been my time

People have faith in me
I think I once did too
I promise whoever has a hold on our lives
I ll see the bad times through
I wake up and I look at the clock
In the middle of the night my heart stops
When I see you in the moonlight
I know why I'm in love

Peace will come I promise you
I wish you success in all you do
And when I think about the rest
I know why I'm in love

It's hard to find the kind of thing
You've searched for all your life
Someone bright and crazy
With a little soul inside
And looking at you fast asleep
I thank the stars above

And what more can I say
I've said it all in different ways
The bottom line, the simple facts are true
I know why I'm in love with you
I only hope you know I love you too

I kiss you and I melt inside
What you mean to me I can't describe
And if seeing is believing
You'd know why I'm in loveNoneBaby what's wrong
Is it something that someone has said about me
What have you heard
Is there anything that you want to say to

And baby please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that matters

Come and sit down
And tell me just what is wrong with you
Don't you believe
The stories that tell you that I'm not true
I'd like to know
About the things you have heard
I'd hate to think of the things
Which mighht have occured

Baby believe me
I'll always love you
And please, please don't you cry
Don't let the tears drown your eyes
Baby listen to what I say
I love you and that's all that mattersTu sei l , io son qui
E fra noi c'  un mare di silenzio
Sbaglier , forse s , ma gi  sento
L'amaro dell'addio
Sono freddi gli occhi tuoi
Cosa c'  che non mi vuoi 
Faccio il primo passo
Ma che ho 
Faccio il primo passo
Tremo un po'
Faccio il primo passo
Tu sorridi un poco
Faccio il primo passo
Forse   solo un gioco
Faccio il primo passo
Gi  si rompe il ghiaccio
Faccio il primo passo
Tu mi prendi in braccio

 cado gi 
E scatta un temporale in me
Baller , forse s , ma per 
Un dubbio mi rimane
Sono freddi gli occhi tuoi
Cosa c'  che non mi vuoi 
Faccio il primo passo

Out in the night
When there's no one in sight
I'm alone
I've lost my way
And it's true when I say
I'm alone
How do I feel 
When I know that I'm really alone


All I need is a friend to carry on
Help me up 'cause I'm going back on my own

Things never last
Seems the die has been cast
In my life, oh
I never know
What tomorrow will blow in my sight, yeah
I have to bend
If it's only mend
What I am


All I need is a friend to carry on, oh-ho
Help me up 'cause I'm going back on my own


I'm alone
I'm alone
I'm alone
So alone, yeah


I'm alone
Out in the night
When there's no one in sight
I'm alone
I've lost my way
And it's true when I say
I'm alone
Things never last
Seems the die has been cast
I'm alone
I've lost my way
And it's true when I say
"I meant to do my work today
The brown bird sang in the apple tree
I know that's why ....
And a butterfly flittered accross the field
And all the leaves were calling me
And the Buttercups nodded their smiling heads
Greeting the bees who came to call
And I asked the lizard the time of day....."
And the wind went sighing over the land
Tossing the grasses to and fro
And a rainbow held out its shining hand 
So what could I do but laugh and go 
Well, there's slim times when my words won't rhyme
And the hills I face are a long hard climb
I just sit cross-legged with my old guitar
Ooh, it kinda makes me feel like a rock 'n' roll star


Well it makes me laugh, Lord, it makes me cry
And I think, for once, let me just get high
Let me get electric, put a silk suit on
Turn my old guitar into a tommy gun


And root-toot-shoot myself to fame
Every kid alive gonna know my name
An overnight phenomenon like there's never been
A motivated supersonic king of the scene


I'll be a teenage idol, just give me a break
I'm gonna be a teenage idol, no matter how long it takes
You can't imagine what it means to me
I'm going to grab myself a place in history
A teenage idol, ooh
That's what I'm gonna be


Oh, the joke was never hard to tell
Threw my spare change in the wishing well
The dream alone is always in your hands
If that don't fill the boy and build the man
A heart has many secrets, so I'm told
Through the years, a theory can grow cold
I'm up to be the king, it's gotten clear
The voice inside my head is the one I hear


Singing, I'm gonna love me again
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know 
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know 
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again

Hoo-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh


The golden age was somehow bittersweet
But now the past lies sleepin' in the deep
The peaceful days that followed hollow nights
A kiss or touch could feel like Kryptonite
Praise the Saints that hung up on my wall
For trust is left in lovers after all
A whispered word emergin' from a tale
My wake-up call to claim the cursed spell


Well, I'm gonna love me again 
Check in on my very best friend
Find the wind to fill my sails
Rise above the broken rails
Unbound by any ties that break or bend
I'm free, and don't you know 
No clown to claim he used to know me then
I'm free, and don't you know 
And oh-oh-oh, I'm gonna love me again



I'm still here, but yet I'm gone
I don't play guitar or sing my songs
They never defined who I am
The man that loves you 'til the end


You're the last person I will love
You're the last face I will recall
And best of all


I'm not gonna miss you
Not gonna miss you


I'm never gonna hold you like I did
Or say "I love you" to the kids
You're never gonna see it in my eyes
It's not gonna hurt me when you cry


I'm never gonna know what you go through
All the things I say or do
All the hurt and all the pain
One thing selfishly remains

Ready, set, go man go
I got a girl that I love so


I'm ready, ready, ready Teddy
I'm ready, ready, ready to rock and roll


Going to the corner, pick up my sweetie pie
She's my rock and roll, baby, she's the apple of my eye




All the flat top cats and all the dungaree dolls
Are headed for the gym to the sock hop ball
The joint is really jumping, the cats are going wild
The music really sends me, I dig that crazy style







I'm still standing!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
I'm still standing!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice
And there's a cold, lonely light that shines from you
You'll wind up like the wreck you hide behind that mask you use
And did you think this fool could never win 
Well look at me, I'm a-comin' back again
I got a taste of love in a simple way
And if you need to know while I'm still standin'
You just fade away


Don't you know I'm still standin' better than I ever did 
Lookin' like a true survivor, feelin' like a little kid
And I'm still standin' after all this time
Pickin' up the pieces of my life without you on my mind


I'm still standin' 
I'm still standin' 


Once, I never coulda hoped to win
You're startin' down the road, leavin' me again
The threats you made were meant to cut me down
And if our love was just a circus, you'd be a clown by now

You could never know what it's like
Your blood, like winter, freezes just like ice

You know I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor, feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing after all this time
Picking up the pieces of my life without you on my mind
I'm still standing 
I'm still standing 
I'm still standing 
I'm still standing 

I'm no longer counting I'm not keeping score
I could say my list of lovers doesn't matter anymore
But some are always in my heart
And some I'm not so sure
Either way they all left their mark
And for some I found a cure


From one you learn something
Another you learn, nothing
And there's one who might teach you everything
But before I learned to listen
And if indeed someone said it
Then I guess i must have lost it on the wind


Back when I was younger each one was a prize
Love just came along and hit you right between the eyes
And one was just a trophy catch
And one was like a curse
Some would want to bleed you dry
Some might quench your thirst


If you want a lover
I'll do anything you ask me to
And if you want another kind of love
I'll wear a mask for you

If you want a partner, hold my hand
If you want to strike me down in anger
Here I stand
Baby I'm your man

If you want a boxer
I will step into the ring for you
And if you want a doctor
I'll examine every inch of you
If you want a driver, climb inside
Or if you want to take me for a ride
You know you can
Baby I'm your man

The moon's too bright
The chain's too tight
The beast won't go to sleep
I've been running through these promises to you
That I made and I could not keep

But a man never got a woman back
Not by begging on his knees
Or I'd crawl to you baby
I'd fall at your feet

And I'd howl at your beauty
Like a dog in heat
And I'd claw at your heart
And I'd tear at your sheet
I'd say please
I'm your man

And if you gotta sleep a moment on the road
I will steer for you
And if yo want to work the street alone
I'll disappear for you

Pull the string and I'll wink at you, I'm your puppet
I'll do funny things if you want me to, I'm your puppet
I'll be yours to have and to hold
Darling you've got full control of your puppet
Pull another string and I'll kiss your lips, I'm your puppet
Snap your finger and I'll turn you some flips, I'm your puppet
Your every wish is my command
All you got to do is wiggle your little hand


I'm your puppet, I'm your puppet


I'm just a toy, just a funny boy
That makes you laugh when you're blue
I'll be wonderful, do just what I'm told
I'll do anything for you




Pull them little strings and I'll sing you a song, I'm your puppet
Make me do right or make me do wrong, I'm your puppet
Treat me good and I'll do anything
I'm just a puppet an you hold my string
As he awoke that evening with the smell of wood-smoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hangin' upon a painted teepee
He went to see his chieftain with his war lance and his woman
For they told him that the yellow moon would very soon be leaving
"oh, this I can't believe, "he said, "I won't believe our war lord's dead!
He would not leave the chosen ones to the buzzards and the soldiers' guns"

Oh, great father of the Iroquois, ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke and breast-fed on the sound of drums
I've learned to hurl the tomahawk and ride a painted pony wild
To run the gauntlet of the Sioux, to make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch the red men's race be slowly crushed 
What kind of words are these to hear from yellow dog, whom the white man fears 

I take only what is mine; my pony, my squaw, and my child
I can't stay to see you die, along with my tribe's pride

I go to search for the yellow moon and the fathers of our sons
Where the red sun sinks in the hills of gold and the healing waters run

Tramplin' down the prairie rose, leaving hooftracks in the sand
Those who wish to follow me, I welcome with my hand
I heard from passing renegades, Geronimo was dead
He'd been laying down his weapons when they filled him full of lead
As I awoke this evening
With the smell of woodsmoke clinging
Like a gentle cobweb hanging
Upon a painted tepee
Oh, I went to see my chieftain
With my warlance and my woman
For he told us that the yellow moon
Would very soon be leaving
This I can't believe I said
I can't believe our Warlord's dead
Oh, he would not leave the chosen ones
To the buzzards and the soldiers' guns

Oh, great father of the Iroquois
Ever since I was young
I've read the writing of the smoke
And breast-fed on the sound of drums

To make a chieftain's daughter mine

And now you ask that I should watch
The red man's race be slowly crushed 
What kind of words are these to hear
From Yellow Dog, whom white man fears

You're not a ship to carry my life
You are nailed to my love in many lonely nights
I've strayed from the cottages and found myself here
For I need your love, your love protects my fears


And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind
But I need you to turn to when I act so blind
And I need you to turn to when I lose control
You're my guardian angel who keeps out the cold


Did you paint your smile on  Well, I said I knew
That my reason for living was for loving you
We're related in feeling but you're high above
You're pure and you're gentle with the grace of a dove


And I wonder sometimes and I know I'm unkind

Thank you. 

Well, she swept through the church
Like a sweet Sunday prayer
While the choir sang "Son of Heaven"
And the groom just walked on air

I was killing time with Jesus
When the wedding bells began
And I saw the most beautiful woman
Getting married to a handsome man


She walked like a mystery
And she passed like summer rain
And she said "I do" like an angel
But I never knew her name

Oh, the congregation gathered
But in darkness I remained
In love with the bride of a handsome man
But I never knew her name


In the shadow of the holy
Oh, I heard my tell-tale heart
Whisper words that never reached her
As her vows were made at last

Lipstick and lashes, the traces of stardom
Lit up on a billboard so everyone sees them in neon
Behind the counter she stares out the window
Up at the billboard that's like a reminder in neon


She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For two cents of danger she'd trust anybody
She'd smoke like a gun if it meant she might wind up

In neon, the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon, the name's gone, there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door


In neon
In neon


Pictures and patterns, the touches of glamour
Cut into a fashion that flashes above them in neon
A hot cup of coffee held in her fingers
A perfect complexion that lingers above her in neon


She hates how she feels but she hangs like a mirror
Maybe a stranger could walk in and see her in neon
For a shot at the title, she'd slip into something
She'd smolder like ashes if it meant she might wind up


In neon, the dreams in the light of a promise that dies
A shimmering city, a glimmer of hope and a lie
In neon, the name's gone, there's no reason why anymore
Trust them and wind up alone behind a locked door

Take your time and tell me
Why you lied
I realise that we've been found out
This time
We should stand together if we can
But what you've planned
Means there's a difference between


What you're gonna say in private
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do in public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember


So discreet
I never tried to meet
Your friends or interfere
I took a back seat between


What you're gonna say in private
You still want my love
We're in this together
And what you're gonna do in public
Say you were never in love
That you can remember
There's a lot of ways to go
And a lot of things we never said
Ready and waiting
Anticipating
Looking ahead

Let me see beyond your smile
Come to me before I fade away
I ran to the helpless
Childishly I yearned
Could it be that I was finally touched by love

In return, in return, in return, in return, in return
In return, in return, in return, in return, in return

Think of all the life we love to love
And feel my spirit soaring high above
Once in a while, won't you tell me
All I need to know
I need to know
I gotta know

You're leaving me speechless
Childishly I yearned
Could it be that I was finally touched by love
When you're standing on the side of a hill
Feeling like your day may be done
Here it comes, the strawberry smog
Chasing away the sun
Don't let those precious moments fool you
Happiness is getting you down
A rainbow never smiles or blinks
It's just a candy colored frown

You were going on at half-past seven
Now it's going on a quarter to nine
All the angels want to know
Are you lost or treading water 
And you're going on your fifteenth bender
But you've only got a matter of time
Yes we've all got seeds to sow
Not everyone's got lambs to slaughter

When the night wind starts to turn
Into the ocean breeze
And the dew drops sting and burn
Like angry honey bees
That is when you'll hear the song falling from the sky
Happy yesterday to all
We were born to die
In the morning there's a feeling
As I free my eyes of sleep
And think only of him running
To the promise he must keep

Such a love I've never known
It fills my life with joy
Oh the miracles the morning brings
The dark cannot destroy

You may find if he's there
It eases your mind
And besides he's so kind
It makes you feel fine
In the morning
Through my window comes a light
Like none that I have known
Well the night has passed between us
And the love has grown and grown

Like a river through a valley
Where the waters never end
Spinning down and always onwardNone
Got a penny in my pocket
And a dollar in my hand
But I'll drop it in your tin cup
Cause you were a one man band
If I could make a million
On some TV show
On the roulette wheel
In a great big casino


I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you
I got my favorite hat
With that snakeskin band
When you need a little shake
I've put it in your hands
To the bottom of the ocean
I would surely dive
To find the oldest oyster
With the biggest pearl inside


I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you


I'd claim a country
I'd claim a tune
All the undiscovered territory
Out there beyond the moon


I'd go ahead and do it
But only if I knew
I could go ahead and claim it
In the name of you
Whatever worth I'd choose
Whatever tricks I'd use
I would find a way to claim it
In the name of you

In the summertime when the weather is high
You can stretch right up and touch the sky
When the weather's fine
You got women, you got women on your mind
Have a drink, have a draft
Go out and see what you can find
If her daddy's rich, take her out for a meal
If her daddy's poor, just do what you feel
Speed along the lane, do a ton or a ton and twenty-five
When the sun goes down, you can make it
Make it good and then they buy
We're not grey people, we're not dirty we're not mean
We love everybody, but we do as we please
When the weather's fine, we go fishing or go swimming in the sea
We're always happy, Life's for living, yeah that's our philosophy


Sing along with us, de de de-de-dee
Da da da-da-da, yeah we're hap-happy
Da da da-da-da-da-da da da-da da


When the winter's here, yeah it's party time
Bring you bottle, wear your bright clothes cause it will soon be summer time
And we'll sing again, we'll go driving or maybe we'll settle down down
If she's rich, if she's nice, bring your friends and we'll all go into townHere you are again
Still the same old wayward child
Runnin' blinded
Just the sight of your sweet face
Can erase the empty hours
And leave them all behind me

Like a tide
Over upon that shore
Any time you are away from me
You're like the sea
Love will always go
On and on into eternity

Save your alibis
Hold your guilty head up high
Lullabying
I don't care what you been doin'
Words are few and far between us
I can see no sense in lying

Like a tide
You're rise and fallin'
Any time you are away from me
You're like the sea
Love will always go
On and on into eternity
I'm moving out of Tombstone, yeah, with the sun behind my back
I'm tired of people talking of things that I lack
Ever since a week ago, the day he passed away
I've been taking too much notice of the things they've had to say
And all they say is, "You ain't half the man he used to be
He had strength and he worked his life to feed his family"
So if that's the way it has to be, I'll say goodbye to you
For I'm not that guy, or so it seems, to fill my old man's shoes


Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes




Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I can't see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes

Like I'm a wicked way of life, the kind that should be tamed
They'd like to see me locked in jail and tied up in their chains
Oh, it's hard and I cannot see what they want me to do, Lord, Lord
They seem to think I should step into the old man's shoes
Io, straniera, ho dormito qui
Anticamente ho sognato di pi 
Il tuo viso di sera mai
Perde luce, luce, tu vedrai
Io, straniera, pace trover 

La scogliera, s , mi accoglier 
Pregher  con la mia voce che s infranger 
Un gabbiano dorme in volo, la mia anima sar 
Io, straniera, piano soffrir 

Amico tu, pescatore, gli orizzonti miei
Si oscurano, non vedo pi 
Dammi fede, la mia rete   vuota
  l ora, dimmi tu cosa pescher 

Io, straniera, pace trover 
Dopo il sole non mi fermer 
Spiegher  che cosa sei e ti perdoner 
Veglier  lass  sospesa una mano ti dar 
Io, straniera, pace trover 
Io, io, io, straniera, non mi fermer 
Io, straniera, io... ti aspetto qui!
Yeah
What 
Yeah I got that real money
It ain't funny how much money
It's some real money
Yeah
Yo bitch lookin' at me funny
Probably because she ain't really used to this money
I'm a boss, I'm a player
Real fuckin' money maker
Yo bitch know my name is, uhm-
I don't know man, you know what I'm saying 
Ayy, yeah
Imma let my boy Jon take over


She packed my bags last night, pre-flight 
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m 
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
High as a kite by then 
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife 
It's lonely out in space 
Who the fuck you think you're fuckin' with
I'm the fuckin' boss
I shoot your son, I shoot your boss
And tell your bitch "get lost"
I got the sauce like I'm Lil Squeaky
Yo bitch fly to Tahiki just to fuckin' meet me
She wanted to meet me, wanna eat me like a fuckin' sandwich
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Ay, yo bitch, she mad because I'm doing damage
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, you know that I'm rich as I bitch
And I'm rough on your bitch and I don't give a shit
And I'm smoking the-
Okay, ayy
Well, she was just seventeen
And you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went boom
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine

Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
How could I dance with another
When I saw her standing there
When I saw her standing there
"I'd like to thank Elton and the boys for having me on tonight. We tried to think of a number to finish off with so I could get out of here and be safe, and we thought we'd do a number of an old estranged fiance of mine called Paul. This is one I never sang, it's an old Beatle number and we just about know it."

Well, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another 
When I saw her standing there

Well she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another 
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there

Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine...

Whoah, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there
I see your teeth flash, Jamaican honey, so sweet
Down where Lexington cross 47th street
Oh, she's a big girl, she's standin' six-foot-three
Turnin' tricks for the dudes in the big city


Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world 
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world

Well, she's black as coal, but she burn like a fire
And she wrap herself around you like a well-worn tire
You feel her nail scratch your back just like a rake
Oh, he one more gone, he one more John who make the mistake


Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world 
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man's world


Island girl
What you wantin' with your white man's world 
Island girl
Black boy want you in his island world
He want to take you from your racket boss
He want to save you, but the cause is lost
Island girl, island girl, island girl
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
Tell me what you wantin' with your white man
We are still all right
We took it on the chin
But in the thirteenth hour
No one ever wins
But we're strong enough
Like traffic all tied up
And when the static clears
The radios still buzz


And I stop and I breathe
Because you wanted me
And I wanted you so bad
And I stop and I breathe
Because I still believe
No one really knows what it is that we have


Like blood in a vein
We chased this one down
And in the darkest long night
We turned it all around
And it was coal-dusted snow
That covered the fields
But the corn it still grew
And the injury healed
In the nicotine glare of a cold naked light
I drag my body from the covers and down forty flights
I run out the front door into the center of the street
I scream out your name as the steam just swells around my feet

I hear you after midnight from the inner city
As every little Cinderella turns to drop dead pretty
We were built out of the darkness into this West Side Story
We came together in the shadows but the moon just steals our glory

Well, this is my battleground, baby
This is my plaything
The only thing I've ever known
Outside of a wedding ring

And I swear I heard the night talking
Cursing me for being a little more than hopeless
Telling me we're running lonely, loose and broken
Stronger now on passion but haven't we really spoken
And all we ever do, is listen to the night talking

On the burden of insanity, we can't find the cause
On a flatbed truck, well, the home girl, she paints her claws
There's a coward who gets his courage under cover of the dark
And it's a strange breed of the devil, freeze at night to go walking in the park
Well you go out on the mountain top, and you look out across the sea
And you know there's another place, perhaps that a young man could be
And you jump back down to the rooftops, and you look out across the town
And you know there's a lot of the strange things circulating around

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down

All you people you got your problems, that ain't nothing new
With patience and understanding, you can get you through
It can get you through, Lord, and take you to the end
It can take you up, oh Lord, and let you down again
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down
Yeah keep it going down

Satisfaction, satisfaction, tell me who is satisfied 
Well she take it and she hold it out, deep down inside
Well she holds it deep inside, Lord, and she bites you with her teeth
All the woman really wants, Lord, she can give her some relief

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down

It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down
It ain't easy, it ain't easy
It ain't easy to go to heaven when you're going down
It isn't going to be easy from now on
You've been messing around while I've been gone
But sometimes telling the truth can be unkind
Folks who suffer guilt can be so blind
It isn't going to be easy I can tell
Just how empty I'm feeling you know damn well
I'm telling you it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out honey you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be easy and that's for sure
Changing things back the way they were before
Once you've lifted the lid on such pain
It isn't easy to put it back again
It isn't going to be easy to forget
Now you've been seeing a man that I am not met
I'm telling you that it ain't gonna be easy from the start
Look out baby, you're playing with my heart
It isn't going to be so easy this time around
Turning back the clock on what's gone down
Oh there comes a time when you need to make a stand
You got to play your cards or fold a losing hand


And it isn't going to be easy and that's no lie
But if you're willing to try it so am I
It ain't gonna be so easy from the start
You better look out darling, you're playing with my heart

I'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise


I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues
A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta be in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they are 
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night
None
Many a tear has to fall
But it's all in the game
All in the wonderful game
That we know has love
You have words with him
And your future's looking kind of dim
But these things
Your heart can rise above
Once in a while he won't call
Oh but it's all in the game
Soon he'll be there at your side
With a sweet okay

And he'll kiss your lips
And caress your waiting fingertips
And your heart will fly away


Come on sing it now
Do-do-do-do-do do doo, oh yeah


When I look back upon my life
It's always with a sense of shame
I've always been the one to blame
For everything I long to do
No matter when or where or who
Has one thing in common, too


It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I've ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin


At school, they taught me how to be
So pure in thought and word and deed
They didn't quite succeed
For everything I long to do
No matter when or wh re or who
Has one thing in common, too


It's a, it's a, it's a, it's a sin
It's a sin
Everything I'v  ever done
Everything I ever do
Every place I've ever been
Everywhere I'm going to
It's a sin

It's getting dark in here
Don't want to leave
Shadow's falling
And I believe
Winds picking up
Thing's so unclear
I'm afraid of my shadow
And it's getting dark in here
I'm scared of strangers
On the street
World's so ugly
I can't breath
Moon's so spooky
I'm close to tears
I've lost it all
And it's getting dark in here

And the wait isn't worth what i'm getting
Sometimes i feel i'm on fire
I've been handed a curse and a blessing
My life's been stripped down to the wire
And i'm trying to get back and hold on
Find someone somewhere who cares
But the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here


Don't talk about angels
Or how i'll be saved
I'm no coward
But i'm not that brave
Rags are blowing
Rain's getting near
I'm done with running
And it's getting dark in here




Yeah, the sun's always setting on my life
And it's sure getting dark in here
Hey there
Look in the mirror
Are you afraid you might see me looking at you
Waiting, waiting at windows
Oh it's me that you need
Yes it's me and I'm waiting for you


But I remain silent
Oh I won't say a word
I leave you to realise I'm the light in your world


And it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you're needing
It's me, yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
That you need
Yes it's me, yes it's me, yes it's me
If you want to be living
I'm the one who's forgiving
Admit that it's me that you need


Watching, watching the swallows fly
It all means the same
Just like them
You can fly home again
But don't, no don't forget yesterday
Pride is an ugly word girl
And you still know my name
None
Ah-ooh
Ah-ooh


I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
 Ow
There again, they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in the interim
The interim, the interim, that's me and them
Oh, my God


It's tough to be a God
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really, you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those pray rs and those salaams 
And who am I to bridle
If I'm forced to b  an idol 
If they say that I'm a God
That's what I am

I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim
The town's already on its knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
I barely know the words to any hymn


Listen, if we don't comply
With the locals' wishes I
Can see us being sacrificed or stuffed
Let's be gods, the perks are great
El Dorado on a plate
Local feeling should not be rebuffed


It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a terrifying notion
All those prayers and those salaams
Any normal man would bridle
If he's forced to be an idol
And a normal man's exactly what I am

I hardly think I'm qualified
To come across all sanctified
I just don't cut it with the cherubim

There again they're on their knees
Being worshipped is a breeze
Which rather suits us in the interim
(The interim, the interim, that's me and him
Oh my god!)

It's tough to be a god
Tread where mortals have not trod
Be deified when really you're a sham
Be an object of devotion
Be the subject of psalms
It's a rather touching notion
All those prayers and those salaams
And who am I to bridle if I'm forced to be an idol 
If they say that I'm a god that's what I am!


What's more, if we don't comply with the locals' wishes
I can see us being sacrificed or stuffed

So let's be gods, the perks are great!

El Dorado on a plate

Local feeling should not be rebuffed
Never rebuffed
A-never rebuff a local feeling, no, my friend!


It's tough to be a god
But if you get the peoples' nod
Count your blessings

Keep 'em sweet
That's our advice

Be a symbol of perfection
Be a legend, be occult
Take their praise, take the collection
As the multitudes exalt
Don a supernatural habit
We'd be crazy not to grab it! 
So sign up two new gods for paradise
Paradise!I didn't mean to hurt you
You know it's just my way
Those things that I said yesterday
Were things I shouldn't say
Although you're blue
Just one thing I want you to do
Just forget all those things
That I said about you

'Cause I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And if you go away
I just won't know what to do

Yes I've been loving you baby
Loving you baby for a long time
And you know in your heart
That I'll always worship you

I couldn't bear to see you go
Oh no no no no
So don't you feel sad
It's not the thing to do
Because I worry
If I know you're feeling blue
Please put your tears away
So nobody can see
'Cause the last thing I want
Is for you to cry over me
I am the elder Utah Smith
I've got two wings to fly
They may be made of paper
They may never reach the sky
But I believe in mercy
I believe that man is good
And if they want two wings like me
There's a chance they could


I am the elder Utah Smith
I was born in Cedar Grove
That's in Louisiana
On a dirt-poor stretch of road
I found the calling early
Gave birth to righteous words
And in a tent around the South
I took my sonic church


I was a light for the living
And I spoke of peace and love
With two wings and my old Gibson
I bought blessings from above
I was here and I was gone
Just a heartbeat from the past
But I went from paper wings
To the real thing at last

I can see by your eyes you must be lying
When you think I don't have a clue
Baby, you're crazy
If you think that you can fool me
Because I've seen that movie too


The one where the players are acting surprised
Saying love's just a four letter word
Between forcing smiles
With the knives in their eyes
Well, their actions become so absurd


So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
That I've seen that movie too
So keep your auditions for somebody
Who hasn't got so much to lose
'Cause you can tell by the lines I'm reciting
I've seen that movie too


It's a habit I have, I don't get pushed around
Stop twinkling your star like you do
I'm not the blueprint
For all of your B-films
Because I've seen that movie too

Tune in, wouldn't it be something 
Rumours spreading into panic
I've seen movements in the clearing
Someone sent you something satanic
I have to leave you, radar's calling
Outside somebody landed
Crazy wavelengths leave you helpless
Oh, don't forget me, I'm so stranded


I wouldn't fool you but I, I've seen the saucers
So many times I'm almost in tune
Watching them flying in formation
Thinking how I could be so immune
I've seen them, I've been there with them
I can tell you all you want to know
Something touched me and I was only sleeping
Wouldn't you, wouldn't you like to go 


Star climbing into their planets
Systems won, controlled from birth
Empty living on this highway
Can you see me, Mother Earth 
It's so endless whirling onwards
Wonder what's cooking at home tonight
Maybe if I promise not to say a word
They can get me back before the morning light

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like him, so irresponsible
A man like him is dead in places
Other men feel liberated
I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughenin' up around my heart
I want love on my own terms
After everything I have ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh God, I've seen so much traffic

]
But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
(Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that means something
That's the love I want,) I want love
I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated


I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothin', I just feel cold
Don't feel nothin', just old scars
Toughenin' up around my heart


But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love, that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want
I want love


I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh, man I've seen so much traffic

I want love, but it's impossible
A man like me, so irresponsible
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated


And I can't love, shot full of holes
Don't feel nothing, I just feel cold
Don't feel nothing, just old scars
Toughening up around my heart

But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love


I want love on my own terms
After everything I've ever learned
Me, I carry too much baggage
Oh man, I've seen so much traffic


But I want love, just a different kind
I want love, won't break me down
Won't brick me up, won't fence me in
I want a love that don't mean a thing
That's the love I want, I want love


So bring it on, I've been bruised
Don't give me love that's clean and smooth
I'm ready for the rougher stuff
No sweet romance, I've had enough
A man like me is dead in places
Other men feel liberated

Don't chastise me,I'm a child acting as a child does
You ply me with the lifeless dolls when what I want is blood
You took me from the streets to complete this union
Do you expect some little saint, kneeling for communion 

I want more
I want more

Look at you, you dissaprove!
Like two fussy mothers
Who are you to criticize the habits of another 
Did I rob the family gold by dining on the help 
Aren't I just the little beast
Well, I can't help myself!

I want more
I want more

I don't want their milk and honey
They can keep those finer teas
I don't need their chocolate, hot and sweet
It's thick and red for me

For everyone that comes along
Knocking on this door
Don't blame me, it's your fault
That I want more!


I wish we were leaving
I wish we were in somebody's car
Going faster
Then we get home
And that would be enough

I'd look at the ceiling
And feel like I was in somebody's arms
Who really loved me
But we won't get that far



Cause you've got your eyes set on something that I don't see
Whenever you smile it's for something that I don't feel
And one day you'll be so good for somebody
For somebody
And one day you'll make somebody so happy
But it won't be me



Small talk, big nights
You're showing a sign that you're not alright
Going faster than you wanted
Because it's not enough
So tired of believing
Love's gonna get you through the night
There's no laughter when you take things this far
Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Heard they got you going round the goosecreek shed
Trying to fill your belly full of buckshot lead

Go jack-rabbit get the cabbage patch
Farmer left the back porch door on the latch
Heard you coming and he got his gun
Better go jack-rabbit better start to run

Go jack-rabbit running through the wood
You had a good night and you feel real loose
Gunfire breaking up the peaceful night
Jack-rabbit lying in the cold daylight
J  houve um tempo de acreditar
Que a justi a iria renovar
Nossa exist ncia, nossas leis
Ja fomos grandes
Fomos reis
A nossa f  n o vai morrer
Mesmo que tentem nos deter
Podem at  nos enterrar
Mas os nossos sonhos ir o brotar

N s somos fortes e somos um
Todos juntos pelo bem comum
Na terra fria o corpo d i
Mas unidos podemos enfrentar


Vai l  brilhar, moleque


Valeu, Tony


H  um lugar bem mais gentil
Onde ningu m tem fome ou frio
N o h  tiranos, n o h  dor
E toda vida tem valor

When she gets up in the morning
It's enough to wake the dead
Oh she turning on the radio
And dancing on my head
It's no good living in the sun
Playing guitar all day
Boogalooing with my friends
In that erotic way


Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way

Let the ladies and the gentlemen
Be as rude as they like
On the beaches, oh in the jungle
Where the people feel alright
So do it in Jamaica
Got plenty for you and me
Honky tonking with my baby
In that deep blue sea


Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way




Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling

Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
Dancing with your darling
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
Everybody say
We're all happy in Jamaica
Do Jamaica jerk-off that way
Come on, Jamaica
In Jamaica all day
It's a little bit funny, this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but, girl, if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song, and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind, I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well, a few of the verses, well, th y've got me quite cross
But th  sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

Must have been the right month
Must have been a good time
Must have counted every cloud in the sky that night
Every single glass of wine
Must have learned some home truths
Sitting in that cool grass
Must have counted every blade in that emerald field
Every shooting star that passed


Should have had a talk with God
Sitting in the great unknown
Watching all the lovers in the world get together
Sitting in Heaven all alone

And we were love's knot after summer
Tied together in the dead of winter
Wrapped up with spring fever in the air
Bound together in the autumn
Every month means a little something
But January is the month that cares


Must have kissed you until I hurt you
Must have been a wild night
Must have rolled in the ashes at the break of day
Rag dolls in the mornin' light
Must have found a secret place
Hiding in our own world
Must have counted every smile on your sweet, sweet lips
Every single sound we heard




Outside I can hear the fireworks
Beyond the paper walls
Where the symbols painted black and white
Run together when the rain falls
And the wind chimes across Kyoto
Each time the earth moves
Was it the quake that shook me
Or was it something to do with you


And the hot wind heats the bamboo blinds
And your almond eyes always shine
Sitting cool behind your painted fan
All the secrets of the east
Conceal the beauty and the beast
For tender is the man in her Japanese hands


Flesh on silk looks different
Than on a cotton sheet back home
Where no one wears their hair like yours
Beneath those oriental combs
And with your thirsty fingers
Running up and down my spine
You forget the western woman
When you're sleeping on Kyoto time

Som konge bli'r jeg m gtig st rk

Med s r'n en smule h r 
Som konge bli'r jeg verdenskendt
Den st rste vi har haft

Haha, det lyder som en... gammel klarinet

Du har meget at l re endnu, unge herre, hvis du tror, at 


Ingen siger: "G r det" 
Ingen siger: "Bli' her" 
Ingen siger: "Stop det"
Ingen siger: "Se her" 
Frihed hele dagen lang 
Jeg bestemmer slagets gang

En snak om slid og sl b
Tror du, en konge modta'r
Gode r d fra fugles n b

J'ai trop r v  dans ma jeunesse
Aujourd'hui j'lance des s.o.s
Et j'fous ma bouteille   la mer
Je cherche amour beaucoup d'tendresse
Calins partout beaucoup d'caresse
Ciel toujours bleu bisous  a presse
Beaucoup d'beaux jours et plus d'hivers
S'abstenir si pas gentillesse
I dreamt too much in my youth

I'm sending out an s.o.s. today

And i throw my bottle into the sea

I'm looking for love and a lot of tenderness

Sweet-talk reassurance from everywhere

I want an everblue sky and kisses right away

Many lovely days and many winters

Are not without gentleness

Tendresse tendresse
J'veux d'la tendresse
J'veux du ciel bleu toujours toujou
J'veux des enfants plein ma maison
Des guitares des rires des chansons
J'veus qu'on s'aime
J'veux plus qu'on me blesse

Tenderness, tenderness

C'est moi Simba, c'est moi le roi
Du royaume animal
C'est bien la premi re fois qu'on voit un roi
Avec si peu de poils
Je vais faire dans la cour des grands
Une entr e triomphale
En poussant tr s royalement
Un rugissement bestial !
Majest , tu ne te mouches pas du coude
Je voudrais d j   tre roi
Il y a encore un long chemin   faire, votre altesse, je vous le dis

Au roi on ne dit pas
D'ailleurs quand je dis  a...
Tiens ta langue et tais-toi
Ce que je veux dire...
Surtout ne fais pas  a
Restes ici, assieds-toi
Restez ici !
Sans jamais dire o  je vais
Alors l  c'est inadmissible
Je veux faire ce qu il me pla t


Il est grand temps, votre grandeur qu'on parle de c ur   c ur
Le roi n'a que faire des conseils d'une vieille corneille
Si tu confonds la monarchie avec la tyrannie
Vive la r publique, adieu l'Afrique, je ferme la boutique
Prends garde Lion, ne te trompe pas de voie
Je voudrais d j   tre roi




Regardez bien   l'ouest
Regardez bien   l'est
Mon pouvoir sans conteste, Et sans fronti res 
C'est une rumeur qui monte jusqu'au ciel
Les animaux r pandent la nouvelle
Simba sera le nouveau Roi Soleil
Je voudrais d j   tre roi
Il voudrait d j   tre roi

I'm looking at a funeral wagon rolling down
A two-lane highway winding past a desert town
A big blue canvas painted by the Master's hand
The shifting clouds above and endless miles of sand
In that mirror maybe that's what's left of me
Wheezing like a freight train hauling sixty tons of steel
Air them out's the best release and get some rest
Carrie don't wait up for me the brakeman's going West


In this room all alone
I dream of you
In this drawer I found someone
I never knew

Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian
I've seen dusty beaten delta boys cutting heads
A black face carney showman scare a song to death
In my short life I've seen as much as most men need
Now I'm just looking for some cleaner air to breathe



Now I pop a top and stay up late with Gideon
And fall asleep to visions of Meridian


Far away, far away
So many years, so many days
All along this broken land
I've seen a lover's empty arms
And hunger's empty hand


Deep down in Louisiana close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens
There stood an log cabin made of earth and wood
Where lived a country boy named Johnny B. Goode
Who never learned to read or write so well
But he could play a guitar just like ringing a bell


Go, go, go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode

He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack
Sat beneath the tree by the railroad track
An engineer could see him sitting in the shade
Strumming with the rhythm that the drivers made
The people passing by, they would stop and say
Oh my, how that little country boy could play


Go, go, go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode


His mother told him, someday you will be a man
You will be the leader of a big old band
Many people coming from miles around
To hear you play your music when the sun goes down
And maybe someday your name will be in lights
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight


Go, go, go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go Johnny, go, go, go
Go, go, Johnny B. Goode
Well your eyes just haven't been the same, Joseph
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph 
There's a pale moonshine above you
Do you see both sides  Do they shove you around 


Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph 
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph 
When the holy night is upon you
Will you do what's right  The position is yours

From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a child
When she took her stand, did she hold your hand 
Will your faith stand still or run away 
Run away


When they've driven you so far
That you think you're gonna drop
Do you wish you were back there
At the carpenter shop 


With the plane and the lathe
The work never drove you mad
You're a maker, a creator
Not just somebody's dad


From the temple walls to the New York night
Our decisions rest on a man
When I take the stand, will he hold my hand 
Will my faith stand still or run away 

None
Remember Belgium and the Brussels Museum
Where we piled on the front steps like stray cavaliers
Our code of living meant little to others
The few francs we saved bought some cheap souvenirs


But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium


Just like a hustler when they look attractive
It's nothing much more than a slap on the back
The price tag of being just a little bit different
The first rule to learn is to keep your own distance


But the red lights where the cat fights make it just like Belgium
See us face down on the floor of another cheap barroom
Streetwalkers sweet talk you out of your spare change
And your sweet madame makes it seem just like Belgium
Just like Belgium



It's just like Noah's ark
There's two of every kind
Pretty girls and boys in drag
Walking a fine thin line
Shaking hands and bussing cheeks
Licking their lips like they could eat
Me alive in a couple of weeks
Yea just like Noah's ark
Italiano promotion men
Chomping a big cigar
Slapping backs and making cracks
About the fags in the bar
Radio boss dipping his nose in a little white packet
You put it out son and we'll all back it
Yea it's just like Noah's ark

And the waves are crashing round us
But we're ready for the flood
And we don't need a sign like an olive branch
In the beak of a snow white dove
We're not as dumb as we might look
You can't keep us in the dark
With me and you it's two by two just like Noah's ark


These four walls have seen
The cockettes and the casters
From San Francisco to Ohio
I've seen beauty and disaster
Cocky young roosters and little chicks
Flashing smiles, shaking them hips
Trying to hook it up for the late night shift
Here in Noah's ark




And we wrote it as we saw it from the centre of the stage
All access to the liars who claim they wrote a page
But for every tiny dancer there's a dog that's had its day
The truth is never quite the same as what the papers say

I looked up from my glass into the sky
There's no one in my comic book to buy
Calendar swung on the wall held by a rusty nail
Down came the strange rain and washed my thoughts away

 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain


Still I sit beside the fire and watched as it fell
Come in colours from above into my citadel
My eyes are all embroidered with the rainbow you have made
And now it seems as though it's just, just like strange rain

 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane


It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain
It made the rain that came seem strange
Just like strange rain

 
So stop in the sky and tell me why
You're changing your colours before my eyes
Yellow, blue, green and grey
Settled on the window pane

Sie ist das A und O. Wo 
Sie werden sich verlieben, glaub es mir
Dann sind wir nur noch zwo. Oh!

Die z rtliche Begegnung
Ist wie ein Zauberbann
Es ist ja so romantisch
Aber das Desaster f ngt erst an

Kann es wirklich Liebe sein
Im sanften Abendwind
Die Harmonie
Voll tiefer Friedlichkeit
Mit allem was wir sind


Wie soll ich s ihr erkl ren 
Ob sie es auch versteht 
Sie will die Wahrheit, die Vergangenheit
Wer wei  ob sie dann geht


Was will er nur verbergen 
Er tut s die ganze Zeit
Warum will er kein K nig sein
Denn als K nig w r  er frei


Kann es wirklich Liebe sein
Im sanften Abendwind
Die Harmonie, voll tiefer Friedlichkeit
Mit allem was wir sind
Kann es wirklich Liebe sein 
Sp rst du sie  berall 
Endlich Eins
Im Schutz der Dunkelheit
Liebe ist erwacht

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well


We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon


Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so, would I still be here today 
And I can see it very well


We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soonNoneHave been thinking of you
And the long years we moved through
To be friends at the end
Which was not the end
But the start of understanding

Have been thinking of you
And the good things you told me
Just to be friends till the end of the road and longer
At the heart of understanding
At the start of understanding
And I have been thinking of you
And the long years we moved through
Just to be friends till the end
Which was not the end
But the start of understanding
At the heart of understanding

Well, she looked a peach in the dress she made
When she was still her mama's little girl
And when she walked down the aisle, everybody smiled
At her innocence and curls
And when the preacher said, "Is there anyone here
Got a reason why they shouldn't wed "


I shoulda stuck up my hand
I shoulda got up to stand
And this is what I should have said

I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!


Underneath her veil, I could see a tear
Tricklin' down her pretty face
And when he slipped on the ring, I knew everything
Would never be the same again
But if the groom woulda known, he'd have had a fit
About his wife and the things we did


And what I planned to say
Yeah, on her weddin' day
Well, I thought it, but I kept it hid


I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!
Long before she met him, she was mine, mine, mine
Don't say, "I do", say, "bye, bye, bye"
And lemme kiss the bride, yeah!
I wanna kiss the bride, yeah!

My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you sleep so still 
I'll wake you tomorrow
And you will be my pill, yes, you will be my pill


My Lady D'Arbanville
Why do you grieve me so 
But your heart seems so silent
Why do you breathe so low, why do you breathe so low 



My Lady D'Arbanville
You look so cold tonight
Your legs feel like winter
Your skin has turned to white, your skin has turned to white






I love you, my lady
Though in your grave you lie
I'll always be with you
This rose will never die, this rose will never die
When the shrill winds are screaming
And the evening is still
Lady Samantha glides over the hills
In a long satin dress that she wears every day
Her home is the hillside, her bed is the grave

 
Lady Samantha glides like a tiger
Over the hills with no one beside her
No one comes near
They all live in fear
But Lady Samantha, she sheds only tears


The tales that I told round the fire every night
Are out of proportion and none of them right
She is harmless and empty of anything bad
For she once had something that most of you have

Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
No not over there
A little bit left and over there
Now look and see the lilac tree
The lily pond, the skylark's song
The open air but no one cares
If branches live and die out there


Remember when you were nine
And I was ten
We would run into the wood
No we never will again
And Lady, what's tomorrow
What's tomorrow anyway
If it's not the same as now
It's the same as yesterday
Yes Lady, what's tomorrow
Will it be the same as now
Will the farmer push the pen
Will the writer pull the plough


Look up little brother
Can you see the clover
Oh sorry but it's over
Now there's concrete and no clover

C'est terrible, c'est affreux

S'ils s'enfuient vers leur r ve ce soir
Dans leur folle ronde
Si notre ami nous dit au revoir
Nous serons seuls au mondeThey're barring the doors at the back of the hall
It's cold in the winter, some freeze in the fall
The banquet's the supper that's set for the swine
If you're not at the gathering, and you've gone down the line

You're the last to arrive, you're the first one to leave
You don't give us the time, you don't drop us a line
Well a dime in the phone is the best way I know
You're the last to arrive, my friend you're the first one to go

The truck picks you up on your front porch at night
And you're back before sundown if you don't get blind
We're not chaining you down to your castle tonight
We're just trying to make you see some sort of light

They'll all drink your health out of pewter and wood
Get drunk in the hayloft playing dirty and good
There's ten pounds of oxen were skewered on spit
There'll not be an ounce if you don't make it quick
Grey London morning
Wet London streets
Rain on the window
Wind in the trees
It's my time to write
It's your time to call
There's something about distance
That gets to us all


Dark clouds above me
Little people below
All walk with a purpose
With someplace to go
It's my place to paint
My own selfish scene
On this cold lonely canvas
It's just the weather and me

And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude


Cracks in the sidewalks
Dogs on the run
An old poster reading
"Give us your sons"
Window frames capture
Moments in time
But latitude captures
The heart and the mind


And latitude
Fold back the morning and bring on the night
There's an alien moon
That hangs between darkness and light
Latitude
Between me and you
You're a straight line of distance
A cold stretch of black across blue
Latitude

Oh, you keep it up
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Hmmm
Ooh, ooh, ah-ah, ah-ah
Yeah


All the broken people put your hands up high 
If you lift 'em up, you might just touch the sky
All the lonely people put your hands up high 
If you loosen up, you might just learn to fly


All the highs and the lows
And the weight, it all goes
You can't let them keep you down 
If you're lost if you're broke, if you're stuck on the road
You can turn it all around
'Cause we gotta trust in love
Something that can't beat us
A feeling to live to serve
All in the name of love

Do you pray to someone new
When you're locked up in the rock
Is the golden age dead and gone
Are the hands stuck on the clock
Can you talk to Buddy's bones
When you spin a 45
The king ain't dead, he's just asleep
Somewhere in the afterlife


And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Laid back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day

We all need to smell the heat
You know that things go better with chrome
Is Memphis real or just a song
Three thousand miles from home
Be a cool jerk , don't work
When fashion makes you change
Keep the faith, don't waste
Another nickel on another name


And look at them boys in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Laid back to back, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day


And idolize twisted cars
Like taxi cabs and spiders
Eternity's just down the road
They're looking for more riders


Look at them boys, yeah, in leather jackets
Second skin, not fade away
Danger girls love leather jackets
Laid back to back, yeah, and that'll be the day
Leather jackets, that'll be the day

Your accountant called this morning
There was springtime in his heart
He couldn't wait to tell me
How he'd pulled our lives apart
And the letter from your lawyer
Lies unopened on the tray
I may get around to reading it later today
Walking round the lonely rooms
I see everything the same
But suddenly it matters
What was purchased in my name
Whether this or that was paid for
Belongs to me or you
Can the seven years together be divided by two

It says something for the legal boys
But nothing much for us
That all we had together
Is so quickly ended thus
The legal boys have won again
And you and I have lost
They can't tell us how it happened
But they'll let us know the cost
Oh they'll let us know the cost, oh yeah


There's a lot I'd like to tell you
But I can't get past your guards
I do not speak their language
And they hold all the cards
I would rather call you darling
Than defendant in the case
But lovers left here long ago
And clients took their place


Say I got a halo, but a set of horns is what I rep
They tell me blow my top like volcanos
But death is sworn I bet
With all these meds I swallow, my head of thorns
Will just cause my final breathe
No it doesn t, no more judgement, slow those punches
Need to stop, I m witholdin' grudges
Losing friends and I m actin' like I m withholding nothin'
Petty schemes with any means that s necessary
Pretty rings there s many things that s less than scary
Legendary, underground in my cemetery
Then I found the sounds for my di tary
I m almost twenty and not even famous
I hat  it, I m constantly changin'
Provide for my family, can t even work
I m as broke as my back and I m beating addiction
So tell me which feeling is worse
The last I was truly happy
Was seein' my son being brought to this earth
But I m still feeling numb and I hate my self
'Cause I should of cried so what am I worth 


Yeah

Neste ciclo
Ciclo sem fim
Ciclo sem fimLes grands orages, de venir a moi
J'ai la dans mes poings, la force de vivre
Et le filet du temps, n'est que l'ombre qui passe
Et voila le present que je regarde en face

J'ai en moi la vie, j'ai en moi le feu
J'ai en moi la tempete de celui qui veut
J'ai en moi la vie, j'ai en moi le feu
J'ai en moi la tempete, si je sais qu'on est deux

Je suis l'eau qui dort, et le roseau qui plie
J'ai le calme tranquille de la douceur des nuits
J'ai la patience immence et le fil du pass 
Et j'ai les mains tendues pour prendre et pour donnerI may not seem your ideal when you look into my eyes
I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes, I'm not the custom made size
But baby let me take you out on the highway for a while
I'll show yow where the man in me is when he doesn't hide
Well he's cruising in the fast lane, stuck behind the wheel
Jekyll and Hyde going on inside when I'm your automobile

Let me be your car for a while child
Shift me into gear and I'll be there
Fill me up with five star gasoline girl
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere

Let me be your car, come on and drive me
I'm a speedy little boy down deep inside
I got bucket seats and two speed window cleaners
Just let me be your car, oh come on and ride

I can't dance, I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen, and baby I can crawl
Well my physique don't look the way the physiques really should
But then again I've got an engine underneath my hood

When I'm cutting up the road with a sports car on my tail
Frankenstein's inside my mind, and the wind's inside my sails
I may not seem your ideal
When you look into my eyes
I don't smoke, I don't tell jokes
I'm not the custom made size
But baby let me take you
Out on the highway for a while
I'll show you where the man in me
Is when he doesn't hide

Fill me up with five-star gasoline
I'll be your car, I'll take you anywhere


Don't you know I can't dance
I don't dig it, I can't see it at all
You say I'm just a specimen

My physique just don't look
The way the physiques really should

Levon wears his war wound like a crown
He calls his child Jesus
'Cause he likes the name
And he sends him to the finest school in town

Levon, Levon likes his money
He makes a lot they say
Spends his days counting
In the garage by the motorway

He was born a pauper to a pawn on a Christmas Day
When the New York Times said God is dead
And the war's begun
Alvin Tostig has a son today

And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon
In tradition with the family plan
And he shall be Levon
And he shall be a good man
And he shall be Levon

Levon sells cartoon balloons in town
His family business thrives
Jesus blows up balloons all day
Sits on the porch swing watching them fly

Some lie about who they love
Some lie about the truth
Some lie to save their lives
Some lie about their youth


Some lie about age and beauty
The conquest of sex
Most lie about the night before
A woman lies for a party dress


I've lied for a stolen moment
I've lied for one more clue
I've lied about most everything
But I never lied to you


And we lie, lie, lie
On a streetcar named desire
Oh we lie, lie, lie
For that sweet bird of youth
I could be great like Tennessee Williams
If I could only hear something
That sounds like the truth
Like father, like son
Like father, like son
Like father, like son

Don't come on so cocksure boy, you can't escape your genes
No point in feeling purer boy, your background intervenes
Listen good and listen straight, you're not the master of your fate
To this you must be reconciled, you'll always be your father's child
At times acclaimed, at times reviled
You wind up doing just what I've done
Like father, like son
Like father, like son

Don't assume your vices get handed down the line
That a parent's blood suffices to condemn the child's design
I've done wrong, I can't deny, but at least I know that I
Shouldn't blame that on my stock, this may come as quite a shock
But I'm no chip off any block, I wouldn't wish those words on anyone
Like father, like son
Like father, like son

Son, you're nervous, take my hand
All is settled, all is planned
You've got the world at your command
I don't think you understand

She looked so easy 'cause she looked so young
With a geisha smile made in Taiwan
She got cherry bombs inside her eyes
And the luck of the Irish on her side
Don't let her tell you that she loves your mind
She's got her price, oh, she can turn on a dime
Those crocodile tears ain't tears of pain
Oh, look a little closer, that's acid rain


And I don't know
Why li'l 'frigerator you're so cold
Go, li'l 'frigerator go
Get away from my soul
Oh, li'l 'frigerator you're so cold


She's calculated with the kiss of death
Got a digital mind and expensive dress
She's an empty shell, woo, young piece of meat
Just another statistic, oh, on her readout sheet


Oh, but I don't know
Why li'l 'frigerator, you're so cold
Go, li'l 'frigerator, go
Get away from my soul
Oh, li'l 'frigerator, you're so cold

Mufasa siempre ha ejercido demasiado control a la hora de cazar

Porque una hiena jam s est  satisfecha
Mufasa es demasiado fuerte para retarlo


Mufasa es historia pasada
Es un viejo rey nada m s
Y va proclamando sus fallas
Que urge un cambio ya

Es amplia y las pueda abarcar


Listos ya para el golpe del siglo
Listos ya para un acto genial
Plane ndolo todo
Con mucho cuidado
A un lado me hac an
Y no me qu r an
Ser  respetado
Amado, alabado
Por  l gran portento que soy
Y mis sue os al fin llegar n
 Listos ya!

In two long wars, my country bled
To save the world for everyone
As through the years, the fight we've led
Too long, we stood alone, too long alone
And when at last, the battle won
We asked for no reward
An empire gone
Two generations turned to blood and dust
Only the best were lost
Only the best

And now the years have passed
The times have changed
The foe is risen up
He stands astride the world
His dreams of conquest all fulfilled

Little island, little island
Glory lost in the mists of time
They will pay for what was done
To those of us who died so young
They will pay for what was done
Little island, little island
Little island
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
And you take it where it strikes
And give it to the likes of me
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much love, little Jeannie
So I see you when I can
You make me all a man can be


And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
And oh, Jeannie, you were always someone's fool

Little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
Though you've grown beyond your years
You still retain the fears of youth
Oh, little Jeannie
You got so much time, little Jeannie
But you're burnin' it up so fast
Searchin' for some lasting truth


And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others who would treat you cruel
But oh, Jeannie, I will always be your fool




And I want you to be my acrobat
I want you to be my lover
Oh, there were others, and I've known quite a few
But oh, Jeannie, I'm still in love with you


You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie,  I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie,  I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie,  I'm so in love with you
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie,  I'm so in love, I'm so in love
You stepped into my life from a bad dream
Makin' the life that I had seem suddenly shiny and new
Oh, Jeannie,  I'm so in love, I'm so in love
I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues


And his promise made was never clear
It just carved itself in me
All I saw was frost inside my head
On the night he said to me


Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses


We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate

I can't control this flesh and blood
That's wrapped around my bones
It moves beneath me, like a river
Into the great unknown
I stepped onto the moving stairs
Before I could tie my shoes
Pried a harp out the fingers of a renegade
Who lived and died the blues


La promessa non fu chiara
S'erra solo impressa in me
Vidi solo il gelo dentro me
Quella notte dise a me

Vivrem comme cavalli
Liberi dai recinti di ferro
Che piu non voglio
Rinnegare i sensi
Su dai fuggiam
Vivrem comme cavalli


We're the victims of the heartbreak
That kept us short of breath
Trapped above these bloodless streets
Without a safety net
I stood in line to join the trial
One more customer of fate
Claimed a spoke in the wheel of a wagon train
On the road to the golden gate


Nel deserto la nave abbandonai
Per me aveva senso
Son stato troppo tempo nella bestia
Ed ora saro libero


Someday, we'll live like horses
Free rein from your old, iron fences
There's more ways than one to regain your senses
Break out the stalls, and we'll live like horses someday

Lonely boy, get up and fly
Lonely boy, get up and try
Everyone knows you got what it takes
All you need is one or two good breaks
Lonely boy, this is your time
Lonely boy, you're on the line
This just could be the only throw you got
Get on up and give it your best shot


You gotta make it lonely boy
You can take it lonely boy
Oh do-da-do-da-day
You gotta do it lonely boy
Get into it lonely boy
Oh take it all the way

Lonely boy, you are the one
Lonely boy, your chance has come
Destiny gonna put you to the test
Face the music and disregard the rest


You gotta make it lonely boy
You can take it lonely boy
Oh do-da-do-da-day
You gotta do it lonely boy
Get into it lonely boy
Oh take it all the way


Oh do-da-do-da-day
Oh do-da-do-da-day
Take it all the way
Do-da-do-da-day
Take it all the way
Do-da-do-da-day
Take it all the way
I guess you're okay
You seem to feel better these days
I've known you for so long
I've seen your brightness go from blue to grey
You know that's true
You can shake your head but I can prove
I've seen things through your eyes
You think you win but in the end you lose


And there's no second guess
We take no second bets
Chances are we're a long way from happiness
Don't cover up the road to love
With words that can't express
The truth implies you're high and dry
And you're a long way from happiness


I'm one step behind
Looking out for you all the time
I'll put my faith in you
And steer you clear of love that leaves you blind

Me and Lonnie thumbed down a Cadillac
Outside Laredo in the heat of the sun
The driver was tanned and he looked like a salesman
We were just children on the run

He talked real funny like we'd never heard
Must have been foreign I guess
And I felt like an actress in an old movie
As Lonnie and I drove west

We were saying goodbye to the ones left behind
Hello to the ones up ahead
Lonnie and me were just drumming our knees
While the radio D.J. said

Keep your eyes open for Lonnie and Josie
Sixteen and fourteen, playing hooky from school
Last seen they were walking the road by the courtroom
Downtown Laredo at a quarter past two

Our friend in the front seat turned around and smiled
Grinning and shaking his head
Asked us politely where we were going
Where the sand turns to sea on the coast, I said

We were crossing the border just out of Texas
Passed the last dusty abandoned old farm
With the AM playing the songs of Sinatra
And Lonnie sleeping in my arms
I've figured out where I went wrong
The script not followed then was awfully long
Too much pluck, too little of
The acting right, not actin' up


I've worn the world upon my back
Would someone else but me pick up the slack 
Just because I could say
It's my life, do things my way


Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground


Color a lot with a broader stroke
The laughter comes as easy as the jokes
Nowadays, I'm thinkin' 'bout
Time is wasted lookin' back


Now I'm lookin' up more than I look down
The view's a whole lot better second time around
Too much of me was hidden in the shadows
I looked up and felt my feet lift off the ground

I'll take a rainy day
To make a champagne shower
Poach some horn and tusk
To build an ivory tower
Been to Philadelphia
The day it was closed
I walked to New Orleans
Down a Louisiana road


The skeletons they hung from the bushes and the trees
But not a skull among 'em said boo to me
In a time of wine and cheap cigars
I'm on top of the world
Top of the world Ma

Look Ma no hands
Look Ma ain't life grand
I'm a super power, I'm a handy man
Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Ain't you proud of me


It takes a silver tongue
To have the Midas touch
Not your alchemist
Making gold from rust
Been down in Roswell
When the Martians came
I sailed to Mandeville
Across Lake Pontchartrain








Didn't I turn out, didn't I turn out to be
Everything you wanted Ma
Aren't you proud of meNone
You hear it every day
Once upon a time they say
Once upon a time in this place
I looked and saw on your face
A smile that spoke to me
In oh so many ways
The Sunday morning bells
Rang out that all was well
Sunshine across the yard
We'd rest when we worked hard
We take a little time off
To appreciate the day


And love builds a garden
Grew it from the ground up
Each one of us knowing
Every inch of it was us
We pulled it all together
Hoping and believing
That love built this garden
For the two of us to dream in


We'd get a little rain
Then the sun came out again
But a frost it's hard to fight
Once it takes hold flowers die
There's only so much you can do
To keep some things alive

Tonight is alright for love
You know I want to touch you where the lights don't go
Tonight is alright for love, love gravy
Expressing love so sweet
I want to keep you burnin' like a dog in heat
Tonight is alright for love, love graaavaaay

Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Elton John!


Oooo tonight
Oooo it's all right
Oooo tonight is right for love, love gravy
You can take her
Make her change her name
You and your old money
Dance around the flame
But you can never, never love her like me
You can charm her
Calm her when she's wild
Show a little comfort
Play with her inner child
But you can never, never love her like me


So I just close my eyes and steal her away when you sleep
Sneak her in my dreams every single day of the week
You may have her in real world but if you could only see
How we rock this room in the twilight zone
And you can never, never love her like me


You can warm her
Charm her with your style
I know you convinced her
She's the love of your life
And no, you'll never, never love her like me
You can bless her
Keep her conscience clean
You can undress her
Go all the places I've been
But you'll never, never love her like me
We follow the dog who follows the cat
We swallow the chain if they don't fight back
We come and go, just getting by
We got a flag on the moon, we got a hole in the sky

And each man kills the things he loves
It's an edible romance we all dream of
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal
Woman is a criminal
She have the hunger
But man is the animal
And love eats love, eats love
Love is a cannibal
We live in the woods but we hate the trees
We kill off the jungle but we save the leaves
The family face is painted grey
Love letters straight from your heart
Keep us so near while apart
I'm not alone in the night
When I can have all the love you write


I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart



I memorize every line
And I kiss the name that you sign
And darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart


And, darling, then I read again right from the start
Love letters straight from your heart
Living on free food tickets
Water in the milk from the hole in the roof
Where the rain came through
What can we do
Tears from your little sister
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress
Without a patch for the party to go
Oh but you know she'll get by

Because she's living

In the love of the common people
Smiles from the heart of the family man
Daddy's going to buy her a dream to cling to
Mama's going to love her just as much as she can and she can


It's a good thing you don't have bus fare
It would fall through the hole in your pocket
And you'll lose it in the snow on the ground
Out walking your dog to find a job
Trying to keep your hands warm
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through
And it chills you to the bone
You better go home where it's warm

You can live




Living on dreams ain't easy
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit
And the chills stay away
You can take them in stride, for family pride
You know that faith in your foundation
And with a whole lot of love and a warm conversation
And a  prayer making you strong
Where you belong

We met on a rainy evening in the summertime
Don't think I need to tell you more
I needed a raise I worked so hard for this love of mine
Love of mine
Still I got nothing to show for it


Here's a simplification of everything we're going through:
You plus me is bad news
But you're a lovely creation, and I like to think that I am too
My friend said I look better without you


Tongue tied and twisted
Go on, baby, and go to my head


Babe, baby believe me
If I stay, it ain't gonna be easy
Okay, we'll do it your way
But this is the last time, ah
You'll hear the beautiful sound of love coming down

Love on the rocks

Pull my coat around me
Feel the cold wind haunt me
Streets are empty just like me
The murmur of an echo
Seems to come from every window
Is loneliness the same as being free 


I guess I must have been dreaming
To think that I believed in you at all
Now I just can't fight it
As the shadow of the night begins to fall


Love's got a lot to answer for
Oh, I just can't sleep with this feeling anymore
Let the cold night air cool the heat
Of two hearts gone to war
For no matter who wins in the end
Love's got a lot to answer for


All I need is darkness
The best of all protection
Freedom's like the stars in the sky
Alone and cold and burning
Each one keeps it's distance
If only we were stars, you and I
I've been blown away like a printed page
That reads "you're lovesick"
Headline news had me so abused
But I was lovesick

You never tried although I sacrificed
My weaknesses for you
I could have understood, I could have read your looks
I should have known better too

I've been holding out but it's time to shout
You know I'm lovesick
A helping hand for a dying man
Who says he's lovesick
I can't explain why I'll never change
This sickness deep inside
I've been doctored down, I've had the nurse aroundMusic by elton john
Released as a uk b-side in 1980

It looked a lot like the same old thing
I've seen so many times
She was aging fast like a bandit
Born to a life of crime
Meanwhile he held his crown and watched her fall
Just bouncing her around like a rubber ball

Through her washed up eyes she could see
That the ties on her prince were gone
He turned the radio off when they played
What he once had called their song
Well the crystal didn't clink but they drink up more
And when he stayed out late she knew what he stayed out for
Love's so cold when you're growing old and your looks are gone
Love's so cold when your hands don't dance where they once belonged
If he's heading down to the red light and the local bar
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart
Love's so cold when he shoots an arrow through your heart

Due to natural causes she became distorted and she tried to leave
But the winning team had an ace or two up a crooked sleeve
For he knew that her age wouldn't help her get along
And that's what made his hold on her so strong
The words I have to say
May well be simple, but they're true
Until you give your love
There's nothing more that we can do


Love is the opening door
Love is what we came here for
No one could offer you more
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes really seen 

You say it's very hard
To leave behind the life we knew
But there's no other way
And now it's really up to you


Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn
Freedom the lesson we must learn
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes really seen 


Love is the key we must turn
Truth is the flame we must burn

Bound, I am bound, like a knot on a string
Eager to be where my life can begin
Out of the shadow and into the sun
So many things that I should have done

I will untangle myself, so that I can see
I will untangle myself, everything will be
Loving and free

Bound I am bound, like a rope on a swing
Up in the air and then down again
Sure for the first time so clear in my mind
Wise to the feeling I gently unwind
Bound I am bound, ro remember your smile
Something so special doesn't fade away
Sadness is sweet when you've gone for a while
When I see you there'll be a lot to sayI remember yet before we met
With every night and day
I had to live the life
Of a lonely one

Instead of only one

When you said you love me
And we could not be parted
I built my world around you
I'm so thankful that I found you
Loving you, has made my life sweeter than ever

Loving you, has made my life sweeter than  ver, sweeter than ever

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes


Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone


Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ohh


Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high


Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone

I'll give you stars and sunshine
A rainbow at your feet each time you rise
So dry your eyes
The house of yesterday, is crumbling at my feet
But I don't mind, I've had my time
I am but yesterday, and you my child - tomorrow


There's nothing I can give you - for you have more than me
You are the truth, within your youth
I watch you dance and play
The little prince of all that you survey
Each night, each day
I am the good old days, but you my child - tomorrow

If I have any future, it is within your eyes
Each time you smile - my child, my child
The hand of life will rock you
I brought you forth, and then my task was through
I give to you this wondrous view
I am but yesterday, and you my child - mm, tomorrow
And you, my child - you're tomorrow, mm...Pian tippuu j lleen lehdet pihapuun

If I wasn't meant to hold you, what are these two arms for
If I can't protect you, what are these muscles for
If I can't enrich your life, I might as well be poor
If I couldn't see you naked, I might as well be blind
If I couldn't treat you right, wouldn't I be so unkind

And you were made for me
You were made for me
You weren't born to be alone
And you were made for me
You were made for me
You were made for me
Flesh and bone, it's etched in stone
That you were made for me

If I couldn't translate fantasy, imagine how I'd feel
If I couldn't hear your secret, my ears would both be sealed
And if I can't make love to you, this body has no use
If you believe I loved you, you wouldn't need no proof
And if I can't return to you, I wouldn't need my legs to run
I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
I had a quit-me father
I had a love-me mother
I had Little Richard
And that black piano
Oh, that sweet Georgia Peach
And the boy from Tupelo


Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

I was made in England
Out of Cadillac muscle
Face down on a playground
Crying, 'God, send me a brother'
Not a bloody nose
For rock 'n' roll
Give me that sweet Georgian Peach
And the boy from Tupelo


Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Yeah!


I was made in England
Like a blue Cortina
But a Yankee summer
Had a way about her
You had a scent for scandal
Well here's my middle finger
I had forty years of pain
And nothing to cling to


Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England
Woh oh oh oh, I was made in England

I can see very well
There's a boat on the reef with a broken back
And I can see it very well
There's a joke and I know it very well
It's one of those that I told you long ago
Take my word, I'm a madman, don't you know


Once a fool had a good part in the play
If it's so would I still be here today 
It's quite peculiar in a funny sort of way
They think it's very funny everything I say
Get a load of him, he's so insane
You better get your coat, dear, it looks like rain

We'll come again next Thursday afternoon
The in-laws hope they'll see you very soon
But is it in your conscience that you're after
Another glimpse of the madman across the water

The ground's a long way down but I need more
Is the nightmare black or are the windows painted 
Will they come again next week, can my mind really take it

The fuse is set and checked once more
Then left beside a back street door
And in the cold gray light, someone sees a shadow
Run through the night and out of sight
They hide inside a smoke filled room
To hear at last the blast of doom
And so the deed is done, they listen
To the final countdown begun, three, two, one
Madness, it's a kind of madness
That turns good men bad
And we're helpless, caught up
In the madness of a world gone mad
The roar of fire rings out on high
And flames light up the black night sky
A child screams out in fear, a hopeless cry for help
But no one is near enough to hear
As walls collapse and timbers flare
The smell of death hangs in the air
When help at last arrives they try to fight the flame
But nothing survives of all those lives

And it's madness, every time a victim dies
There is madness, burning in a blind man's eyes
And it's madness, hidden in the hate and pain
There is madness, burning in a wild man's brain


And it's madness, every time the bullets start
There is madness, burning in a poor man's heart
And it's madness, something that we can't control
There is madness, burning in a madman's soul, madness
Zazu, why am I not loved 


I am that rare and awesome thing
I'm every inch a king
Yet, I feel a twinge of doubt
As I go walk about


Hey, boss!

When my name is whispered through the pride
Is this talk of love or regicide 


Reggie who 


Tell me I'm adored
Please tell me I'm adored


Hey, boss!


Oh, what is it 


We got a bone to pick with you


There's no food, no water


Yeah. It's dinnertime, and there ain't no stinkin' entrees!

Another bride, another June
Another sunny honeymoon
Another season, another reason
For makin' whoopee


A lot of shoes 
A lot of rice
The groom is nervous 
He answers twice
It's really killin'
That he's so willin' to make whoopee
Picture a little love nest
Down where the roses cling
Picture the same sweet love nest
Think what a year can bring
He's washin' dishes and baby clothes
He's so ambitious, he even sews
But don't forget folks
That's what you get folks
For makin' whoopee
Yeah

Baby, so they give you anythin'
Darlin', all the joy money can bring
Baby, do they bring you happiness
Darlin', you're no different from the rest


Can't you see that it's love you really need
Take my hand, and I'll show what a love could be
Before it's too late


Mama don't want you, daddy don't want you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love
Mama don't want you, daddy don't need you
Give it up, baby, baby, mama can't buy you love


Baby, fancy friends show you a smile
Darlin', rich relations for a while
Baby, I can only give you love
Darlin', a-this old heart should be enough


All I need is a chance to make you mine
Let me in, oh, I'll change the way you feel inside
Before it's too late

Man stands in all his glory
Sitting at the crossroads of the same old story
Man got his make-up, wears it like a mask
Hides inside a child, lives inside a glass
Man breathes his own deceit
Man worships his own defeat


Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man

Shakespeare's men got all the lines
Modern man lives back in time
Man got bravado in his big steel hands
Runs with the wolf, sleeps with the lamb
Man falls, cuts and bleeds
Man stumbles on his own belief


Oh I'm a man
I know what it feels like
I'm a man working on the living part of life
You see through me
I understand
Don't lose hope
If you can
Have a little faith in man


He's the hoax
Behind the thrill
The poison arrow
The bitter pill
Hard to swallow
Hard to kill
Hard to understand
He's the light
Behind the hill
The broken promise
The iron will
Hard to kill
Hard to understand

Rules and regulations
And real estate are things I've left behind
Fights are always leaving
Silver wings unfolding on a dime
But I won't forget to tell you
If I could only reconnect the line
I never really knew you, but come back I'd like to find the time
Drugs and consequences
And ferris wheels just took us up and down
Fights were always brewing
Two perfect understudies for a clown
If I could piece it all together
Or maybe find you through a friend
Last I heard it was St. Louis
But I wish that it was Mandalay Again


Come back I'd like to find the time
Plant a seed and raise a little Cain
Come back we'll throw a rope around the moon
And pretend that we're in Mandalay Again


Fuel and information
Are Siamese twins who poison everything
Lies that left us drowing
Rumor that burned like gasoline
I could have read you like a book
Instead I acted dumb and blind
I was younger then and foolish
Come back I'd like to find the time

It's a case I guess of paradise lost
Ten years back on the hands of the clock
In that little house on Mansfield
On your old block
Sometimes the magic of the past is all we've got
Just you and me at a crossroads then
Isn't it funny how we were old friends
Accidentally thrown together
Did we intend
To be the romantic novel you never want to end


And it's the contact of the eye that meets across a crowded room
And how I kind of wound up the lyrics to your tune
You said, 'Funny but it feels like I've known you all my life
And how it might feel to kiss you on the mouth tonight


In between the Star of David and the California moon
The Santa Ana winds blew warm into your room
We were crazy, wild and running
Blind to the change to come
In that little house on Mansfield
We'd wake at the break of dawn
In an Indian summer gone
Si frantum 
Ci ...
La paura fatta di no
Un vuoto e poi
Tra noi e noi
Barriera non ci fu

Vero amore
Sempre s 
  sempre stato sopra di noi
Un contatto e poi
Frequenti i miei
Sospiri senza dire no

Frammenti di scintille e poi
Sconfinato l'universo in noi

Senti, chi mi libera sei tu
Dimostri quello che sei
Convincendomi di quello che vuoi
Senti, chi mi libera sei tu

Ma tu chi sei 
Ma tu chi sei 
Ma tu chi sei mai

We look at the table
And we look at the time
We see a short fuse burning
We're standing on a land mine

You look at the cold soup
I look at the grey wall
I see a red flag burning
Yeah, man we need a santa claus
Down on the homeless avenue
Down among the rocks and stones
The cradle falls but the buck stops here
Let's think about their hearts and bones

And we all need a medicine man
All need a medicine man
Don't we need a medicine man
His shake and his rattle and his helping hand

See the meat of a nation
On the back of a truck
I think we're waste in a dumpster
Hey sorry kid it's tough luck

She was adorable
And he was a good boy
They were inseparable
Yeah bitten by the cold war

Rags on the shapes of millions
Tears among the cuts and blows
The backbone snaps and the kids can't dance
Let's think about their hearts and bonesYell help, too many cooks and a bird in the bush, yell help
Yell help, if your mirror busts and your cat gets cussed, yell help

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you find another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help

Yell help, some shelter from the storm like the travel agent warned
Yell help, if you can help your superstitions they gonna keep you warm

Because down the road you find someone else who's looking
Down the road you seen another sweet lady cooking
So i gotta yell help
I wish tonight wasn't wednesday night
I wish it wasn't the thirteenth of july 
And you're looking at the guy whose eyes can't deny
That he wishes he were somewhere else tonight 

Well i met this woman down in new orleans
Lord she built just like a dream
Even wore stockings that had seams
And she was ugly
Now hell i don't mind women of her kind
I'll even pay sometimes for a woman that's ugly
She built like a steamroller
Just the kind to mow you over anytime
Hey the moment might arrive

On bourbon street
Well the ugliest woman you'll ever meet
But she's mine all mine and she's ugly
So i better yell help


Yell Help!
Cool grass blowing up the pass
Don't you know I'm feeling mellow 
Oh, I love your roman nose
The way you curl your toes, baby
Make me feel so mellow


It's the same old feeling I get when you're stealing
Back into my bed again
With the curtains closed
Oh, and the window froze
By the rhythm of the rain

Ooh, you make me mellow
Oh, you make me mellow
Rocking smooth and slow
Mellow's the feeling that we get
Watching the coal fire glow
Oh, you make me mellow
Oh, I make you mellow
Wrecking the sheets real fine
Heaven knows what you sent me, Lord
But God, this is a mellow time


Going down to the stores in town
Getting all the things we need
Oh, don't forget the beer
Oh, my little dear
It helps to sow the mellow seed
And it can't be bad, all the love I've had
Coursing through my life
Oh, down in the pass
Where the wind blows fast
And mellow, mellow's feeling right
NoneNone
Here am I, standing by
To see if you still love me
Why conceal, you still feel
The need to push and shove me
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted


Make love and promise it will always be
More than just a memory of


Love will grow, it comes and goes
Emotions can deceive you
Well this I vow, here and now
My love will never never never leave you
Take love for better, take love for worse
But never ever take love for granted
Make love and promise it will always be
Ours for all eternity




More than just a memory of love
Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me


So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the b st of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look b autiful
Right now, Merry Christmas

The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone 
Merry Christmas, everyone


Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah


So just keep kissin' me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas


I feel it when it comes
Every year helpin' us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends
Are together where we all belong
Merry Christmas, everyone

Can you hear it in the distance 
Can you... sense it far away 
Is it old Rudolph the Reindeer 
Is it Santa on his sleigh 
It's heading up to Easington
It's coming down the Tyne
Oh! It's bloody Maggie Thatcher
And Michael Heseltine!


So Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death

They've come to raid your stockings
And to steal your Christmas pud
But don't be too downhearted
It's all for your own good
The economic infrastructure
Must be swept away
To make way for business parks and lower rates of pay, so...


Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
May God's love be with you
We all sing together in one breath
Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher
We all celebrate today
Cos it's one day closer to your death
And they've brought their fascist bootboys
And they've brought the boys in blue
And the whole Trade Union Congress
Will be at the party too
And they'll all hold hands together
All standing in a line
Cos they're privatising Santa
This merry Christmas time, so...

I carried you in my arms
Through the hotel to our room
The night was filled with music
Those old historic tunes
Songs of revolution
Filled our hearts and fed our souls
As the fireworks exploded
Like those cannons long ago


See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See them shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight


Five hundred wooden saints below
The color's cracked and dry
You said their stories should be told
Did they suffer when they died 
Give us your tradition
Give us hope and send us home
We'll be the cracked bells tolling
The voice of dust and bones
I carried you in my arms

Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
The pillow that you dream on
Lies rolled up on the floor
You tossed it at the TV screen
At the drug lord and his war
Thinking of the courtyard
Forced a tear from your eyes
The white shirts in the moonlight
The warm forgiving smiles
See the kids in the candlelight
Spirits on the mend
Every golden child tonight
Just changes on the wind
See the kids in the candlelight
See 'em shining bright
Innocence beyond the fight
See the kids in the candlelight
Yea, yea, yea
Yea, yea, yeaCast a pebble on the water
Watch the ripples gently spreading
Tiny daughter of the Camargue
We were meant to be together
We were made for one another
In a time it takes to grow up
If only we were old enough
Then they might leave us both alone

So take my hand in your hand
Say it's great to be alive
No one's going to find us
No matter how they try
No one's going to find us
It's wonderful so wild beneath the sky

Sleeping in the open
See the shadows softly moving
Take a train towards the southlands
Our time was never better
We shall pass the sights of splendor
On the door of a new life
It had to happen soon I guess
Whether it is wrong or it is right

We learned to be so graceful
Watching wild horses running
And from those agile angels
We knew the tide was turning
For we watched as on the skyway
The herons circled slowly
While we mere mortals watched them fly
Our sleepless eyes grew heavy
Walk a mile in my tennis shoes
Tina Turner gave me the highway blues
But I don't love nobody but you, honey
I'm a true rat for the things I done
Second cousin to a son of a gun
I'm gonna wipe out your mama if she puts me on honey


'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well, there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

Long-haired ladies well they look so fine
Locked in my cellar full of cheap red wine
But I don't think those ladies they really mind, honey
I still don't know why you hate me so
A little bit of fun never stopped no show
Well I, I just wanna loosen up my soul, honey


'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well, there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do 




'Cause I'm a midnight creeper
Ain't gonna lose no sleep over you
When there's a nightmare I'm there
Tempting you to blow a fuse
Well, there's no more sleeping
When I'm midnight creeping over you
Watch out honey, watch out honey
Watch the things you do

I got bands on my wrist
You can t see what im feeling
Keep it a hunnid I got it im keeping
Shawty say she leaving got mixed feelings
Feel like im vibing I got mixed feelings
Drugs in my system they keep calling
DNA like im missing a chromosome
This ain't no game like it s Warzone


Lately been going home and it's empty
Seeing the signs there s not plenty
Got all this jewelry still feeling chewy
Just wearing Louie smoking a doobie
Cannot see clear I smell there's death in the air
But you don t care doesn t seem fair
Nothing is, what's the price I gotta pay
Sold my soul now I fear
Thinking about how the end is near


I got bands on my wrist
You can t see what im feeling
Keep it a hunnid I got it im keeping
Shawty say she leaving got mixed feelings
Feel like im vibing I got mixed feelings
Drugs in my system they keep calling
DNA like im missing a chromosome
This ain't no game like it s Warzone

Now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say
I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

Until you've seen this trash can dream come true
You stand at the edge while people run you through
And I thank the Lord there's people out there like you
I thank the Lord there's people out there like you


While Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters
Sons of bankers, sons of lawyers
Turn around and say good morning to the night
For unless they see the sky
But they can't and that is why
They know not if it's dark outside or light


This Broadway's got
It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown
In New York City

And now I know
"Spanish Harlem" are not just pretty words to say

It's got a lot of songs to sing
If I knew the tunes, I might join in
I'd go my way alone
Grow my own, my own seeds shall be sown in New York City

I thought I knew
But now I know that rose trees never grow
In New York City

None
I used to think that New York City
Fell from grace with God
And innocence abroad
Waged a war for the underdog
When the snow falls
And Central Park looks like a Christmas card
I just looked beyond the bagman
And the madness that makes this city hard

I heard a basketball
Somewhere out beyond a chain link fence
Inner city prisoners
Argue for the right of self defense
But there's a fast break
And every work of art wakes something in the soul
Just focus on the brush strokes
And the bouquets that the dancers hold

Spanish Harlem still sounds good to me
Yeah Mona Lisa's getting older
Standing in the shadow of Miss Liberty
While I walk along the west side
Down through Little Italy
Searching for the city
That took away the kid in me

"Rocket Man"


Oh, she packed my bags last night pre-flight
Zero hour 9AM
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight 


And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Till touch down brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, I'm a rocket man
Rocket man burning out his fuse up here alone
Oh yeah

If you're looking for the glory
You think that you might find
In a bullet-riddled stolen car
On a back road in the pines
If it's round just like a medal
On a tired old man of war
Or hidden like that Burma Star
In my dad's bottom drawer


Look at you in your monkey suit
Driving south, nothing left to prove
You come back here in your cowboy boots
Dressed to kill in your monkey suit
Every pose you strike, every frame they shoot
Shows you dressed to kill in your monkey suit


Build your ladder to the moon
Beat on that sacred drum
Trample on the hands of those
That cling to every rung
Every seed you crush beneath
Like stone ground in a mill
You never drew a decent breath
But you're just dressed to kill
NoneYou're stirring up hatred and you make me ashamed
I really do think that your soul must be maimed
You're trying to tell me it's them or it's us
But I tell you there's no way if we don't build on trust
The world has gone rotten so do what you must
But don't forget love, Mr. Rubin, Oh no don't forget love

Well to your kind I know I'm just one of a crowd
But I hope that you'll listen I don't like talkin' loud
There's a strange lack of vision that's driving you on
There's times to be here you say and times to be gone
And the times that we live in must surely be wrong
But don't forget love, Mr. Rubin, Oh no don't forget love
There's a change due to come and you know it
And you think it's your duty to fight
It's people like you who's gonna blow it
While standin' there blocking the light

Now there's porns of the devil who don't know his name
It's him that they're fighting you'll hear them all claim
But the devil's in you friend when you say we must kill
And fight for you freedom and take what we will
It's been a good year for losers and you head the bill
In a world short on love Mr. Rubin
So don't forget love, Mr. Rubin Oh no, don't forget love
No, don't you forget love, oh no no no, don't forget love
Oh no, don't forget love...
Well, you're stirring up hatred and you make me ashamed
I really do think that your soul must me maimed
You're trying to tell me it's them or it's us
But I tell you there's no way, if we don't build on trust
The world has gone rotten, so do what you must
But don't forget love, Mr. Rubin, oh no, don't forget love

Now, there's pawns of the devil, who don't know his name
It's him that they're fighting, you'll hear them all claim

My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it
My baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes, and she knows how to use it


I was lonely once in this great big world
Just a nowhere man without a girl
Until that lucky day when she came my way
And she smiled at me as if to say



She's the only one, makes me feel so good
Can't believe my love so I knock on wood
All my silent fears seem to fly away
And she smiled at me as if to say

Your baby loves loving, my baby loves loving
She's got what it takes for me


No more lonely nights just waiting for the telephone to ring
No more lonely days, my baby's taking care of everything
I'm telling you people






I'm not the same as I used to be
All the things you've heard seem hard to believe
Haven't always been good, never really been bad
Most times I've been happy, yea sometimes I've been sad
Sure I've made mistakes, haven't we all
I've been loose as a cannon and dumb as a wall
Haven't always been sober in counting my ducks
And if I look back now I've had my share of luck


But the change didn't come over night
I've been searching for you all my life
All the habits that I couldn't handle
I've swept them under the rug
In exchange for the sweetest addiction
You, my elusive drug


I'm going to stay now, I really like it here
I may paint your picture, and i might grow a beard
There were times i was crazy couldn't handle my life
Don't think you'd have liked me not at any old price



From this day on, I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down, below the southern land
What I'd do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
Wear the color of the grey's and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die, I'll wear my father's gun


I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men

Slip us a rope and sail around the bend


As soon as this is over, we'll go home
Plant the seeds of justice in our bones
We'll watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter there when the bells of freedom ring


I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well that's just fine, alright
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men

Slip us a rope and sail around the bend
Oh, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
Mmm, I'd like to know where the riverboat, riverboat sails tonight
'Cause there's fighting there and the company needs men

Slip us a rope and sail around the bend
From this day on I own my father's gun
We dug his shallow grave beneath the sun
I laid his broken body down below the southern land
It wouldn't do to bury him where any Yankee stands
I'll take my horse and I'll ride the Northern plain
To wear the colour of the greys and join the fight again
I will not rest until I know the cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die I'll wear my father's gun


I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
So slip us a rope and sail on round the bend

As soon as this is over we'll go home
To plant the seeds of justice in our bones
To watch the children growing and see the women sewing
There'll be laughter when the bells of freedom ring


I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company, it needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
Oh
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat, the riverboat
The riverboat sails tonight

Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
I'd like to know where the riverboat sails tonight
To New Orleans, well, that's just fine, that's just fine alright
Because there's fighting there and the company needs men
Oh, I said now, oh, I said, slip us a rope and sail on round the bend
From this day on
I own my father's gun
We dug a shallow grave
Beneath the sun

We laid his broken body down
Below the southern land
It'd never do to bury him
Where any Yankee stands

I take my horse
I ride the Northern plain
And wear the color of the free
And join the fight again

I will not rest until I know
The cause is fought and won
From this day on until I die
I'll wear my father's gun


I'd like to know where
The riverboats sail tonight, yeah, yeah
To New Orleans, hey
That's just fine, alright
I hear they're fighting there
And the company needs men
And oh up there  slip us a rope
And sail around the bend 
NoneI see you in the distance and I see us as we are
So nearly so contented but a careless word too far
I see you in confusion for a once enchanted boy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

I longed to love you better but I swear I don't know how
You could have been my future but I had to have it now
The things we love completely we are fated to destroy
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy

It's easy to be certain that another's heart will fall
Much harder to be certain of your own
It moves you, and inspires you then it drives you to the wall
And leaves you so excited but alone

My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh
My heart dances, oh oh, but not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy
But not for joy
Your hot coffee and my black tea
I don't know about that
Oh guess we choose to disagree
But I like your pork pie hat
Well your sister always came between us
Claiming she was best
But she hitched a ride to a diplomat
She moved to Bucharest
While we just sat around an round
Like a dolpha in a bed

I can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell
Oh can't say I ever liked you much
But you're my kind of hell


Battle ins field and New York streets
Were watching from a bridge
But what the theif an you said made no sense
To even stole them anyway
Oh a living cheap in an old hotel
Eating rice and beans
Stayin up late takin a bottle each
With a couple of Times Square queens
We just turned the heat up
On the stories we could tell




Now I'm sunbathing in the sun
Was always on my mind
But you tanned from the inside out
Drinking coco butter wine
While you sold your past life
Baptist fire was miaking plans to leave
But you trapped me that ball his bell 
On another new years eve
So I give it up for what it's worth
Crawling to your shell

I put my life on hold and took you home
Good sense shot down I placed you on a throne
Where was the wheel that kept me on the road
The force of nature preventing overload
So don't you know I've been dressed to kill
If you got the tools be careful what you build
When the arrow's in the bull's-eye every time
It's hard assuming that the archer's blind


My quicksand
Let me introduce you
To my final stand
I went to Paris once
I thought I had a plan
I woke up with an accent
I wound up in quicksand
My quicksand


I was full of foreign notions at the start
There was never once
When I was off my guard
For any ghost of every poet in the ground
There's one like me
To buy the guys a round

In life, one has to face a huge assortment
Of nauseating fads and good advice
There's health, and fitness, diet, and deportment
And other pointless forms of sacrifice
Conversation  Wit  I am a doubter
Manners  Charm  They're no way to impress
So forget the inner me, observe the outer
I am what I wear and how I dress

Oh, now I believe in lookin'
Like my time on earth is cookin'
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fiber on of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect

From your cradle via trousseau
To your deathbed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
For my dress has always been...my strongest suit


Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Now I believe in looking
Like my time on earth is cooking
Whether polka dotted, striped or even checked
With some glamour guaranteeing
Every fibre of my being
Is displayed to quite remarkable effect
From your cradle via trousseau
To your death bed you're on view, so
Never compromise, accept no substitute
I would rather wear a barrel
Than conservative apparel
Because dress has always been my strongest suit
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Staying in or hitting townwards
From the top and working downwards
I ensure that every stitch is stitched in time
Whether wig or hat or turban
Whether clad boudoir or urban
Not to strut your stuff outrageously's a crime
And the few who are invited
To my wardrobe are delighted
As they wander through my things to find en route
That in negligee or formal
I am anything but normal
Because dress has always been my strongest suit

Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere
Overwear, underwear, anytime, anywhere

Now you don't need a recital
Of the reasons why it's vital
That tonight my trappings will not be subdued
That from coronet to sandal
No one else is worth a candle
That I couldn't make more impact in the nude
So bring me all my finest
Most audacious, mi divine-ist
Most revealing, most expensive and taboo
Most arresting, most heart-stopping
Most free flowing, most eye popping
Because dress has always been my strongest suit

I may leave a great impression
As I race through a succession
Of the latest crazes, chase the newest fad
I feel better when beguiling
Find that fashion keeps me smiling
But in my heart I know it's rather sad


That a life of great potential
Is dismissed, inconsequential
And only ever seen as being cute
So I'll flutter to deceive


Oh no you must believe
That one day you're bound to find


A stronger suitEi, novo mundo
Aqui eu vou!
Com meu companheiro
E mais alguns
Pioneiros do maximum
Com a mesma aud cia em cada um
Um time que s  quer vencer
Fazer o sonho vir enfim
At  que fique na neblina
A trilha que deixamos

Transformando a lenda em fato
A hist ria um dia vai contar
Um mito em realidade, temos de tornar
Um mist rio antigo
De mais de mil anos
Vai ser conhecido
Na trilha que deixamos

O para so est  nas m os
Shangri-La
Bendito Ch o
S timo c u que algu m mostrou
Em comum, seja qual for
Onde virgens dan ar o
E selvagens lutar o
E a crian a nunca vai crescer

Sometimes I feel too old to work
Too young to die
But I'll drink wine and whisky
I'll keep smoking 'till I die
I wear a suit of sadness
Made by experience
For I believe that in the end
Time will heal what men can't mend


I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone
I'm a natural sinner
Born a sinner's son
Evil's been my motto
Distrust everyone

Big men with small minds
Now, they're not hard to find
Now they ain't got no good side
It plain greed that covers up what's inside
Now ride the confusion
Withhold your trust
Struck with your own hand
When, you think the cause is just

N o vou contar, se n o vai me deixar


O que   que ele esconde
E n o quer revelar 
Pois dentro dele um rei existe
Mas que n o quer mostrar!

Never meant to be so friendly
Never made the room look nice
Never heed a word of warning
Never take my own advice
I got a brand-new problem
Pretty and she's 5 foot 10
I been in love three times this week
I'm just about to fall again


I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love, again
I don't want to fall in love
Never going to fall in love
I'm never going to fall in love, again

Never meant to be so sexist
It's so hard to overcome
Trying hard to fight the feeling
Lechery can be such fun
Because everywhere there's lots of foxes
And every cat I meet's a tom
I wish she didn't make me rabid
I wish she wouldn't turn me on


Because everywhere there's lots of foxes

Never Say Goodbye
There isn't much I haven't shared
With you along the road
And through it all there'd always be
Tomorrow's episode
Suddenly that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
Ask no questions, take no side
Who's to say who's right or wrong
Whose course is braver run
Will ever be, ask one
What is done has been done for the best
Though the mist in my eyes might suggest
Just a little confusion about what I'll lose
But if I started over I know I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and tought me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Sudenely that isn't true
There's another avenue
Beckoning, the great divide
I would choose
The same joy the same sadness each step of the way
That fought me and taught me that friends never say
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye
Never say goodbye

It's never too late to turn things around
Recover, unravel the path to confound
The doubters and losers that line up despair
Will tell you it's over, you're going nowhere
It's never too late, I hope
It's never too late

It's never too late to get back on track
To get at least some, if not all of it back
I thought I was happy, and sometimes I was
The sadness is just as important because
Got to carry the weight and hope
It's never too late


Never too late to fight the fight
Never too late to keep the night
Never too late to win the day
Never too late to break away
Time will start to move too fast, the time is now, my friends
I'm a long way from the start, but further from the end
Oh no, it's never too late





It's never too late to get up off the ground
Don't have to be noticed, don't have to crowned
I get what I done and I don't try to hide
I lost many things, but never my pride
It's never too late, I know
It's never too late

Don't abandon life
Don't step away
Don't give up that tune
That you never could play
If you're folding your tent
And the gas pipes groan
If every bone rattles
Through nights all alone
Well you're tougher than leather
No old burlap sack
Not some hard scrabble weeds
Growing up through the cracks


Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody
Don't you know, you're never too old
You're never too old to hold somebody


Don't think you've gone out
Don't flicker and fade
If you're going to get lemons
Then do what they say
The wind makes you weary
It knocks you around
Logs on the fire
Beats sun shining down
But you're harder than nails
No skinny old tack
You're still sharp as a razor
And I like you like that
We can spend the night right
So honey turn out the lights
And do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

You can work on a charm
And tell the man in your arms
To do it nice and slow
Do it nice and slow

Lying here in a way that I have always wanted
Close to you in a scene that I have always haunted
Time and time again we defended a right to cling to
Our love-shy goodbyes, for broken hearts could cry

You can do it, you can do it slow
You can do it slow, slow, slow
You can do it slow, slow
Do it nice and slow

You can turn on the heat
To keep a man on the streets
When you do it nice and slow
I like it when you do it nice and slow

You can work on a spell
And weave your magic so well
When you do it nice and slow
Come on and do it nice and slow
When a dear old friend came by today
We sure had a lot to say
Of the time we had so long ago
When answers to a dream were all we needed
To glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were fine
In the night hours
There's a look of sadness in your eyes
As you look at me in recollection
I don't know what you're thinking of
Then you smile
Say "You're looking good, sweet love"
And we glide along our time
We remember, when you and I were standing
We were standing
In the fading shadows
Play that song
The one that made me cry
Sing along your harmonies
Before you say goodbye
There's a look of sadness in my eyes
As I see you now in my reflection
And the time so long ago is clearer now
So we take it kinda slow
And we glide along our time
And something still remains
When you shared your pain with someone
So long ago
So long ago
In the night hours
 the night hours
 the night hours
In the night, in the night, in the night hours
In the night, in the night, in the night hours
In the night, in the night, in the night hours

In the night, in the night, in the night hours

In the night, in the night, in the night hours
Fades
Hey Nikita, is it cold
In your little corner of the world 
You could roll around the globe
And never find a warmer soul to know
Oh, I saw you by the wall
Ten of your tin soldiers in a row
With eyes that looked like ice on fire
The human heart, a captive in the snow


Oh, Nikita, you will never know
Anythin' about my home
I'll never know how good it feels to hold you
Nikita, I need you so
Oh, Nikita, is the other side
Of any given line in time
Countin' ten tin soldiers in a row
Oh no, Nikita, you'll never know


Do you ever dream of me 
And do you ever see the letters that I write 
When you look up through the wire
Nikita, do you count the stars at night 
And if there comes a time
Guns and gates no longer hold you in
And if you're free to make a choice
Just look towards the west and find a friend
I ain't got the strength to lift my fingers
'Cause you have robbed this love from me
Nina I don't mind, that's the way it's gotta be
'Cause Nina you're my woman now

Just as long as it takes
I will heal the mistakes I've made in the past
And our love's gonna last, oh it's gonna last, it's gonna last forever
'Cause Nina you're my woman now

He may have told you that this love won't last
But just allow me one more chance
To prove to you that I love you
More than any man can do
Oh Nina I love you
Believe this one baby
Believe m , I'm no liar
Just light the fuse inside of m 
And set my soul on fire
'Cause Nina you're my woman now

Just let the two of us together
Forget these long gone times
All I need is an answer
Oh Nina, Nina change your mind

'Cause Nina you're, you're my woman now
'Cause Nina you're, you're my woman nowNone
They must have loved each other once
But that was many years ago
And by the time I came along
Things were already going wrong
I felt the pain in their pretense
The side they tried hard not to show
But through the simple eyes of youth
It wasn't hard to see the truth


And in the end nobody wins
When love begins to fall apart
And it's the innocent who pay
When broken dreams get in the way
The game begins, the game nobody wins


They must have loved each other once
Before the magic slipped away
And as their life became a lie
What love remained began to die
I used to hide beneath the sheets
I prayed that time would find a way
But with the passing of the years
I watched as laughter turned to tears

Lady love rides a big red Cadillac
Buys the hoedown show salt and beans
Goes to church to pray for Lucifer
She milked the male population clean


So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise


Come on down, come on down from the ladder
Henry get your head, get your head out of them clouds
What she wants is to go kissing on a swine herd
You might as well kiss the boss man's cow


So ride in line, shake yourself by the hand
Live your life inside a paper can
But you'll never get to pick and choose
She's bought you and sold you
There ain't no shoe strings on Louise
Oh yeah

So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are


And nothing else matters


Never opened myself this way
Life is ours, we live it our way
All these words I don't just say

And nothing else matters


Trust I seek and I find in you
Every day, for us, something new
Open mind for a different view


And nothing else matters


Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know


So close, no matter how far
Couldn't be much more from the heart
Forever trusting who we are


No, nothing else matters


Never cared for what they do
Never cared for what they know
But I know

Almost heaven, West Virginia
Blue ridge mountain, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads


Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, Country roads ohI once knew all the answers
I stood on certain ground
A picture of true happiness
A confidence so effortless
No brighter could be foundOh noI never asked the questions
That trouble me today
I knew all  was to know
Love worn lightly, put on show
My conquests on displayI can't believe he's changingAnd who'd have thought that confidence could die Oh noNot me, not meNot me, not meThat all I took for granted was a lieOh noNot me, not me  Not me,no not meAnd who'd have guessed I'd throw my world away
To be with someone I'm afraid will sayNot me, not meThis can never be
He's in love
But he's not the only one
Who'll be changed

Why hasn't Radames come to see me again  We're to be married in three days, and yet... Aida, I must make things right with him!


I shall not envy lovers
But long for what they share


An empty room is merciless
Don't be surprised if I confess
I need some comfort


And who'd have thought a love could be so good 
Not me, not me
And show me things I never understood
Not me, not me
And who'd have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone 'til his dying day 
Not me, not meAnd who'd have

A conquest on display

And who would have thought his love could be so good
Not me, not me
My secrets and my passions understood
Not me, not me

Who would have guessed he'd throw his world away
To be with someone till his dying day

No more Valentine's Day
No more Christmas cards
I've thrown them all away
No more sequined stars
No birthday wishes
No more surprises
Who needs them anyway 
No reason to get excited
Yes, I gave you everything
I gave you earth and sky
And everything in between
That walks or crawls or flies
No Easter mornings
It's your cross now
Keep it all for yourself
It's overrated anyhow


But keep my Valentine
I'll keep my bleeding heart
Just let me out of here
Before that sentimental music starts
And your regrets
Fall like empty lines
Like the lies we write on Valentine's
I pulled out my stage coach times
And I read the latest news
I tapped my feet in dumb surprise
And of course I saw they knew

The Pinkertons pulled out my bags
And asked me for my name
I stuttered out my answer
And hung my head in shame

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family
Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now I've seen this chain gang
Lord I say let me see my priest
I couldn't have faced your desert sand
Old burning brown backed beast

The poor house they hit me for my kin
And claimed my crumbling walls
Now I know how Reno felt
When he ran from the law

Now they've found me
At last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

Now they've found me
Well I won't run
I'm tired of hearing
There goes a well-known gun

Now they've found me
Lord I say at last they've found me
It's hard to run
From a starving family

I hung out with the old folks
In the hope that I'd get wise
I was trying to bridge the gap
Between the great divide


Hung on every recollection
In the theater of their eyes
Picking up on this and that
In the few that still survived

Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away


They bend like trees in winter
These shuffling old grey lions
Those snow-white stars still gather
Like the belt around Orion


Just to touch the faded lightning
Of their powerful design
Of a generation gathering
For maybe the last time


Call 'em up, n' dust 'em off, let them shine
The ones who hold onto the the ones
They had to leave behind
Those that flew and those that fell
The ones that had to stay
Beneath a little wooden cross oceans away
None
Hey how about this
A little conversation tonight
Thinking aloud how we struggled to find
Our place in the dizzy heights
Don't often do this
We never really get the chance
Nearly froze to death on oxford street
Now we're sitting in the south of France
Talking through the evening
It's good to shoot the breeze
Just you and me on a balcony
And cicadas singing in the trees

Old '67 what a time it was
What a time of innocence, what a time we've lost
Raise a glass and have a laugh, have a laugh or two
Here's to old '67 and an older me and you


Sentimental twilight
Conversing on those virgin days
Laughing about how the two of us sound
Like a Tennessee wWlliams play
Honest, it's amazing
That we can get together at all
For in between the saddle and the grand piano
We can read the writing on the wall
Talking through the evening
Sitting here side by side
Just you and me on a balcony
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside


I want to be good, I want to be strong
But I treated him bad, I've done him wrong
I've taken his money, I'm given him hell
And he takes it all 'cause he knows me well
We can say what we mean and mean what we say
We don't like to mess around
But we're there to hold each other up
When we're falling down


Just like an old friend
Putting me on my feet again
Giving me back my pride then
Letting me go

Just like an old friend
Putting me in my place again
Giving me back my hope then
Letting me know that he's an old friend


I don't suffer no fools, I testify
But he must be one for being by my side
I've broken his heart, I've shaken his tree
But still he doesn't want anything from a fool like me
We won't talk for a year or two
Maybe when we do, we won't say much
Even so we know that out of mind
Is never out of touch




We're having a man-to-man
Don't want to get sentimental
But both of us understand
We'll never have to say goodbye, just see you later


I let the pain just walk on in
And I pulled up the nearest chair
No need to say 'Hey how you been'
We've been friends to long to care

Baby you're the cause of my sleepless nights
But it's not that I'm about to complain
You get used to it, sing your blues to it
Once a fool always a fool

There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
I always find you with an alibi
When I know you're the guilty one
I never ask for a reason why
You come home with the rising sun
What the use of making it harder boy

When it's hard enough already for me
Be it right or wrong I shall play along
Once a fool always a fool

There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
Once a fool always a fool
There's no way to change to be rearranged anymore
Once a fool always a fool
When you ring the bell I can tell who you're ready for
Here's a piece of advice, Billy
Piss off out of here
Start everything a-fresh and don't look back
There is sod-all left for you here
You are very fucking special
Now piss off before I start to cry


Once we built visions on the ground we hewed
We dreamt of justice and of men renewed
All people equal, in all things
We once were heroes
Once were kings
But all great things must come to pass
We know the first will soon be last
And in the ground we may be lain
But a seed is sown to rise again

So we walk proudly
And we walk strong
All together
We will go as one
The ground is empty
And cold as hell
But we all go together when we go

I'm staring down a mile of disappearing track
Is this the best that we could do
I'm leaning through the rain but you ain't looking back
What did I ever have to prove
Because it feels like electricity hitting an open field
When am I ever going to to learn
Married life's two people trying to grab the wheel


Oh and we must have got lost
Living on Dark Street
Looking for an exit
Sleeping on the concrete
You can't see it with your eyes
You can't find it with your feet
All I know is that we're lost baby
And we're living on Dark Street

All the layoffs and the pay cuts cripple me inside
I pay the price for living everyday
Trying to keep us all together along with a little pride
What'll it take to make you stay
But I've dreamed about an island
And all I got's a bucket of sand
I'd give my eyes to give you all your dreams
Now I get to see my family slipping through my hands


You are my weakness
You are my friend
Nothing I have in the world
Makes better sense
'Cause I'm the fish and you're the sea
When we're together
Or when we're apart
There's never a space in-between
The beat of our hearts
'Cause I'm the apple and you're the tree

One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you 


You are my woman
I am your man
Nothing else matters at all
Now I understand
That I'm the door and you're the key
And every morning
I wake in your smile
Feeling your breath on my face
And the love in your eyes
'Cause you're the honey and I am the bee


One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you
One day at a time
Is all we do
One day at a time
Is good for you, you, you 
Saw a Cadillac for the first time yesterday
I'd always seen horses, buggies, bales of hay
'Cause progress here don't move with modern times
There's nothing to steal, so there's not a great deal of crime 


It sure is hell living in a one horse town
There's half a mile of Alabama mud bed ground
Nothing much doing of an afternoon
Unless you're sitting in a rocking chair just picking a tune 


And they ain't too well acquainted with the Stars and Stripes
But if you wanna hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night


'Cause no dice living in a one horse town
Laid back, as my old coon hound
And I just can't wait to get out of this one horse town
Nothing to steal because there's simply nothing much around 


And they ain't too well acquainted with the Stars and Stripes
But if you wanna hear Susanna then they'll pick all night
They'll pick all night

He said I want to grow up
And look like Robert Mitchum
And I hope that when I'm gone
There'll be some say that I miss him
He must have been romantic
He must have sensed adventure
And I feel the steel of his strong will
In the frame around his picture


And he's one more arrow flying through the air
One more arrow landing in a shady spot somewhere
Where the days and nights blend into one
And he can always feel the sun
Through the soft brown earth that holds him
Forever always young


He could have been a boxer
But the fight game seemed so dirty
We argued once he knocked me down
And he cried when he thought he'd hurt me
Strictly from the old school
He was quiet about his pain
And if one in ten could be that brave
I would never hate again

You's a meme, you's a joke, been a gimmick from the go
All the things that you do just to get your face to show
Oh, you think you big shit, big pimpin', let me know
Ain't the next big thing, you the next thing to go
Now, can you prove yourself  Everybody waitin'
I'm just being real, swear somebody hatin'
I don't see you lasting long and that's just me being honest

I bet there are many but how would I know
As she was only one woman
Only one woman
And I've got a picture
Of the woman I love

Who sees my lonely face, who sees my shame
Nobody in the place can tell me her name
 Cause she was only one woman

 Cause she was only one woman

Of the woman I loveI got stuck in a sticky jam
Might've stayed there too
But LA couldn't pin me done
So now I'm sliding through to you

Getting harder to hide
But I can't seem to worry inside
So let's get on the slide
Let's get on the slide
And slide on through
She was cold and down on me
Sometimes I made her mad
Now she's sold every share in me
And all the times we had, too bad

Getting harder to hide
But I can't seem to worry inside
So let's get on the slide
Let's get on the slide
And slide on through

Now I've stopped trying to see myself
The way the rest would like to see me
Once a gypsy, always the same
No other way to be for me, for free

Getting harder to hide
But I can't seem to worry inside
So let's get on the slide
Let's get on the slide
And slide on through

So let's get on the slide
Let's get on the slide
And slide on throughVerleden is verboden
Ik wou dat het verdween
Maar ik zie ons samen lopen
En we wisten niet waarheen
Nog raak ik je aan
Maar de afstand wordt al groot
Nee, ik heb niet geleerd
Te leven met jouw dood

Want ik hou zo van jou
Misschien is het niet waar
Zwaait opeens die deur weer open
En natuurlijk sta jij daar
Want ik hou zo van jou!

Afscheid nam ik niet
En het einde blijft nu open
Zoals jij het achterliet

Ik droom je terug bij mij
Ik hou je zo goed vast
Heb ik je vaak genoeg gezegd dat
Dat er niet   n zo bij mij past
En ze zeggen dat het went
Maar niemand zegt wanneer
Dus ik leef met de dag
En jij sterft telkens weer
None

I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey


How did I get here 
Can't loosen your grip
I'm circling heaven and what a crazy trip
Faster than lightning, straight to the heart
I gotta have you, come as you are

I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
And I hope I never come down, down, down
Down


Some kind of fusion, my heart and your heart
Romantic illusion, lighting up sparks
It's more than beauty, it's more than life itself
Never been lonely, it's you and no one else


I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
And I hope I never come down, down, down
Down, down, down
I'm flying in your orbit, hon y
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, hon y
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I'm flying in your orbit, honey
I was unprepared for fame then everybody knew my name
No more lonely nights, it's all for you
I have traveled many miles, I've seen tears and I've seen smiles
Just remember that it's all for you


Don't forget me as the colours fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay

Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
Many times, I lost control, they tried to kill my rock 'n' roll
Just remember I'm still here for you
I don't wanna say goodbye, when I do, you'll be alright
After all, I did it all for you


Don't forget me as the colours fade
When the lights go down, it's just an empty stage
Okay


Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
Yes, I've been a bad guy, been higher than the blue sky
And the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
I've made mama cry, don't know why I'm still alive
Yes, the truth is I don't wanna die an ordinary man
Oh, it's carnival night
And they're stringing the lights around you
Hanging paper angels
Painting little devils on the roof
Oh the furnace wind
Is a flickering of wings about your face
In a cloud of incense
Yea, it smells like Heaven in this place


I can't eat, can't sleep
Still I hunger for you when you look at me
That face, those eyes
All the sinful pleasures deep inside


Tell me how, you know now, the ways and means of getting in
Underneath my skin
Oh you were always my original sin
And tell me why, I shudder inside, every time we begin
This dangerous game
Oh you were always my original sin


A dream will fly
The moment that you open up your eyes
A dream is just a riddle
Ghosts from every corner of your life
Up in the balcony
All the Romeo's are bleeding for your hand
Blowing theater kisses
Reciting lines they don't understand

Freedom for the scapegoat leaving Reading Jail
Rheumy eyes just pierced his heart like crucifixion nails
Shaking fists and razors gleamed
You never stood a chance
When the ink ran red on Fleet Street
You turned your eyes to France
Humbled far from Dublin, chased across the waves
Your biting wit still sharp enough
To slice through every page
Destitute and beaten by the system of the crown
The bitter pill you swallowed
Tasted sweeter going down

And looking back on the great indifference
Looking back at the limestone walls
Thinking how beauty deceives you
Knowing how love fools us all
A golden boy in velveteen landed in New York
The past was so seductive
When they paid to hear you talk
Baccarat and champagne flutes
Tobacco from Virginia
Long before the lords and law
Branded Oscar Wilde a sinner


And looking back on the cold bleak winter
Looking back on those long dark days
Felt like the head of John the Baptist
In the arms of Salome


Don't turn around it's a white gull screaming
Don't cry out loud you never know who's listening
You've seen it all the exiled Unforgiven
From the stately homes of England to her prisons
None
What's your name 
My name is pain
Where do you live 
I live anyplace
Where were you born 
In the state of fear
How old are you 
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

What's your plan 
My plan is pain
When will you leave 
I'll never go away
How will you breathe 
You'll give me life
How will you see 
Sitting in the temple right between your eyes

My name is pain
You belong to me
You're all I wanted
I'm all you'll ever be
From the beginning
In a world without end
I am the air
I am pain


Pain is love
Pain is pure
Pain is sickness
Pain is the cure
Pain is death
Pain is religion
Pain is life
Pain is television

Pain walks
Pain crawls
Pain is peace
Pain is war

Where were you born 
In the state of fear
How old are you 
Nineteen hundred and ninety-four years

Nobody left in the airport lounge
They cleaned the ashtrays
TV's just wound down


I've got to wait till morning
I've got to last the night
I've only got one book
To see me through my flight

But when I get to Paris
We'll paint all our portraits
In brush-strokes of yellow
And christen the canvas
The left bank is crying
For colour to crown it
Like the roof of a palace
We'll drink in the amber
When I get to Paris
You were the best of Montmartre Street life
You signed the tablecloth
Art has its price
It's so hard to hold on
To the ghost of your breed
It takes ambition
To call the colours you need


Part-time love is bringin' me down
'Cause I just can't get it started with you, my love
Did I hear you sayin' that I'm too hard-hearted
Wipe those stars from your eyes
And you'll get quite a surprise
Because you'll see everybody's got a part-time love


You've been seen runnin' around
There's not much I don't a-hear of, and a-still, you try
Tellin' me all the things I must stay clear of
Don't tell me what to do
When you been doin' it too
Because you, me and everybody's got a part-time love


Fallin', I'm fallin', can't get free
Baby, if you keep on stallin'
Oh, how can I make you see
That you, me and everybody needs a part-time love


Part-time love
I seem to be pullin' in the wrong direction with you, my love
Whatever I do, you raise the same objection
Now, I've got someone at home
But she's got a love of her own
Because you, me and everybody got a part-time love

One, two, one


Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Wanna get on 
He wanna get on 
Wanna get on 
He wanna get on 


To make a chain of fools
You need a matching pair
One hypocritical fool
And a crowd that's never there
There's anger in the silence
There's wheels upon the jail
A black train built of bones
On a copper rail


Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Deny the passenger who wanna get on
Wanna get on 
He wanna get on 
Wanna get on 
He wanna get on 

There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
And it's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you


And can you feel the love tonight 
It is where we are 
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we've got this far, ooh
(Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)

There's a time for everyone if they only learn
That the twisting kaleidoscope moves us all in turn
There's a rhyme and reason to the wild outdoors
When the heart of this star-crossed voyager beats in time with yours


And can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best




Can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are
It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer 
That we've got this far
Can you feel the love tonight  
It is where we are
It's enough to make kings and vagabonds
Believe the very best


Can you feel the love tonight  
The peace the evening brings
The world, for once, in perfect harmony
With all its living thingsJust a perfect day
Drink Sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark
We go home

Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later, a movie too
And then home

Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun

Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good


Oh it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on

You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sowThere she stumbles, falling to her knees
I think she tripped on reality
I have witnessed, tragic comedies
That's the world in which she leads

Well i would walk a million miles
To give her, all that she needs
But she would a walk a million more
To do what she believes

She'll have a perfect day

Troubles blooming, innocence will fade
Still, she's dry through all the rain
There;s no purpose, she has yet to crave
She's like the big dog on parade

Well i would walk a million miles
To give her, all that she needs
She would walk a million more
To do well as she pleased

She had a perfect day

I can't figure this one out
I've no words here to explain
She'll just sugar kiss me off
She'll just have another perfect day
Have now, have now, pay in another life
Kickstart the future, accept this loan
Fill in the form, you're pre-qualified
You're now the sum of what you own


Buy now, buy now, have a better life
Close out transactions without remorse
Apply for credit, it's your given right
Buy it all then buy some more


Buy for comfort, buy for kicks
Buy and buy until it makes you sick
Buy for England, buy it all
Buy online and in the shopping mall
Sell it on then buy it back
Buy the shit you never knew you lacked
Buy the update to compete
Buy the things that make your life complete


Consumer of life, hold my hand, extend your rights
It's the power to purchase to excess
That sets you apart and can give you the ultimate high
Abuser of time, if there's something that you want
You don't need it, but have to concede
It's making you happy and that's all that matters to you

I used to be a rollin' stone, you know
If a cause was right
I'd leave to find the answer on the road
I used to be a heart beatin' for someone
But the times have changed
The less I say, the more my work gets done


'Cause I live and breathe this Philadelphia freedom
From the day that I was born, I've waved the flag
Philadelphia freedom took me knee--high to a man, yeah
Gave me peace of mind my daddy never had

Oh, Philadelphia freedom, shine on me, I love ya
Shine the light through the eyes of the ones left behind
Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light, won't you shine the light 
Philadelphia freedom, I lo-o-ove ya
Yes, I do


If you choose to, you can live your life alone
Some people choose the city 
Some others choose the good old family home

I like livin' easy without family ties 
Til the whippoorwill of freedom zapped me
Right between the eyes

Why's it never light on my lawn 
Why does it rain and never say "Good day" to the newborn 
On the big screen, they showed us the sun
But not as bright in life as the real one
It's never quite the same as the real one


I never learned why meteors were formed
I only farmed in schools that were so warn and torn
If anyone can cry, then so can I
I read books and draw life from the eye
All my life is drawings from the eye



Your mission bells were wrought by ancient men
The roots were formed by twisted roots
Your roots were twisted then
I was reborn before all life could die
The phoenix bird will leave this world to fly
If the phoenix bird can fly, then so can I

Un bisbiglio tra i rami di querce invecchiate
Il primo picnic con te, un po  isolati
Perdona, amore, ma, ma resta qui
Prepara tu intanto, un volo e son qui

La strada si inoltra mi fermerei, no
Oramai tutto intorno sento alberi e amici, ma come 
Sara un'illusione, rivedo chi mi chiamo
Per nome correndo, non eri tu

E il vento corse sopra i rami, poi si ferm 
Tra queste rive esser soli, lui se ne and 
La mente vola, un nodo in gola, gli occhi chiusi perch 
Che dolce la sera, se fosse ancora qui

Il fiume cap  e lento parlo un po  di pi 
Dei miei passi, le incertezze nei suoi no
Io con la mente e col corpo non so per quanto lottai
Lui come grande cometa non si volt 

Scusa amore se un po  tardato io ho
Il primo picnic con te qui, un po' isolati
Io vorrei ma dirti che, che prima di te
Una cometa mai, non crederai

E il vento corse sopra i rami, poi si ferm 
Fra queste rive esser soli, lui se ne and 
La mente vola un nodo in gola
Gli occhi chiusi perch 

One, two, three, four


A picture tells a thousand words, some of them were mine
Combing through the evidence, afraid of what we'll find
The sun could lift us up should this thunder ever stop
There's no over, there's no under, there's no shame


Picture of love, we were a picture of love
The measure of our years so deep and wide
Picture of hope, we were a picture of hope
Standing close together side-by-side


If we let the darkness of these times break us
Oh-oh-oh, that would truly be the crime
Did I cause the sadness in your eyes 
Oh, allow me, please, to ease your troubled mind


Picture of love, we were a picture of love
The measure of our years so deep and wide
Picture of hope, we were a picture of hope
Standing close together side-by-side

Ever since I was a young boy I played the silver ball
From Soho down to Brighton I must've played them all
But I ain't seen nothin' like him in any amusement hall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball


He stands like a statue, becomes part of the machine
Feeling all the bumpers, always playing clean
He plays by intuition, the digit counters fall
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball


He's a pinball wizard, there has to be a twist
A pinball wizard's got such a supple wrist


 I don't know



Well, he ain't got no distractions, can't hear no buzzes and bells
Don't see lights a-flashin', he plays by sense of smell
Always has a replay, never tilts at all
That deaf, dumb, and blind kid sure plays a mean pinball

I don't want to wake you
But I'd like to tell you that I love you
That the candlelight fell like a crescent
Upon your feather pillow
For there's more ways than one
And the ways of the world are a blessing
For when Pinky's dreaming
She owes the world nothing and her silence keeps us guessing


Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's hands

You don't want to tell me
But somehow you've guessed that I know
Oh, when dawn came this morning
You discovered a feeling that burned like a flame in your soul
For there's toast and honey
And there's breakfast in bed on a tray
Oh, it's ten below zero
And we're about to abandon our plans for the day


Pinky's as perfect as the Fourth of July
Quilted and timeless, seldom denied
The trial and the error of my master plan
Now she rolls like the dice in a poor gambler's handsOh Jesse I'd like to be
One of those men up on the screen
With an elegant lady and a cafe in Paris
Serving pernod and kahlua with cream

You can see it, I know
All the doors have been closed in my face
And the drinks at the Casbah
'Bout a mile or more from the place

And oh Jesse won't you look at the planes, tell me
Oh Jesse is it true what they say
There's a capital 'G' in the name of the game
The runway's the home of my silver grey plane
Oh won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jesse aren't those wings just fine
Don't it make you wanna fly
Someday

Why friend am I so still
Tied to my job with time to kill
Do I still bear the traces of my old Don Quixote
Tilting giants on imaginary hills

And oh Jesse won't you look at the planes, tell me
Oh Jesse is it true what they say
There's a capitol 'G' in the name of the game
The runway's the home of my silver grey plane
Oh won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway

All the doors have been closed in my face
And the drinks at the Casbah
Run a mile or more from this place

And oh Jessie won't you look at the planes
Tell me, oh Jessie, is it true what they say
That there's a capital G in the name of the game
And the runway's a home for my silver-red plane
And won't you look at the planes
Riding down the skyway
Jessie ain't those wings just fine
Don't it make you want to fly someday

Why friend am I so still
Tied to my job with time to kill
Do I still bear the traces of old Don Quixote
Tilting giants on imaginary hills
We've been crippled in love
Short changed, hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls
A slogan or two about life
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down


So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you

We've been living with sorrow
Been up, down and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
Stood dazed in the doorway
The king and queen of clowns
We've been flipped like a coin
Both of us landing face-down


So please, please
Let me grow old with you
After everything we've been through
What's left to prove
So please, please, please, oh please
Let me grow old with you


But tied to the same track
The two of us look back
At oncoming trains ahead
How many more times
Can we lay on the line
Watching our love hang by a thread

We've been crippled in love
Short changed and hung out to dry
We've chalked on the walls

So please, please
Please, oh, please
Let me grow old with you


We've been livin' with sorrow
Been up, down, and all around
We've buried our feelings
A little too deep in the ground
None
There's another one due in three month's time
She'll have to paint the spare room blue
She'll work a little overtime
And hope it all works out for Frank and her
If she can keep him home nights
Away from those factory girls


And the gas bills come and the money burns
And Frank just keeps complaining
How little they both earn
And mother drops by Mondays
Just to nag about the world
Then she stays to nag at Dallas
Because she hates those Texas girls

Poor cow
You'll get your dumb man
You'll see your whole life coming at you
In the back of his hand
Poor cow
It's a monkey see town
You'll walk down the aisle
In the hand me down gown
Of some poor cow






Oh them rich bitch girls
Ain't like our lass
Got no spine for labour
Like us working class
Us gamey lot
Still got our pride
We got our health
It's just the truth that's died


There's a porch swing in tupelo
In the shade of the south
Where the sweet honey drips off that old hush-your-mouth
It's a slow road on down
That old natchez trace
Through alabama cotton fields to a state of grace
It's a crisp golden autumn
On the tennessee line
Rolling down to mississippi like you headed back in time
Town's closed on Sunday
Everybody's in church
It's empty as the moon this place here on earth


And this place don't change
Some places move slow
I'm just rocking myself on this porch swing in tupelo
I got nothing to do except hang in the breeze
Ghosts of the old south are all around me
Yea swing high, yea swing low
Here on this porch swing in tupelo


His mama must have loved him
That truck driving boy
With the grease monkey look and the rock and roll voice
Well i was just thinking about him
Because I guess he sat here
Singing all praise to god through poverty's tears
We heard Richard Nixon say,  Welcome to the USA 
The common sense I sometimes lack
Has opened up a seismic crack
We ve fallen in and I can t pull back
And I guess we ll have to stay

In open arms we put our trust they put us on a big red bus
Twin spirits soaking up a dream
Fuel to feed the press machine
After years that were long and lean
We re finally on our way

And Richard Nixon s on his knees he s sent so many overseas
He d like to know if you and me could help him in some way
A little camouflage and glue to mask the evil that men do
A small diversion caused by two
Pale kids come to play
And we heard Richard Nixon say,  Welcome to the USA 

Neither of us understood the way things ticked in Hollywood
We just loaded in and grabbed the bat
With little room to swing a cat
And pretty soon we were  Where it s at 
Or so the papers say

And all around us suntanned teens, beauty like we d never seen
Our heroes led us by the hand
Through Brian Wilson s promised land
Where Disney s God and he commands
Both mice and men to stay

Hienas vulgares e infames
Carentes de qualquer virtude
Guiadas pelo meu talento e engenho
Meu reino far o chegar   sua plenitude


Eu sei que a tua intelig ncia
Nunca foi, nem ser  generosa
Mas prestem aten  o, com paci ncia!
Nas minhas palavras preciosas
Prestem aten  o, concentrem-se
Pois quero que fiquem cientes
Que quando um rei sai outro entra
E   a raz o para ficarem contentes!

Preparados para terem boa vida
Uma vida sensacional
Chegou nova era
A velha j  era


E a gente onde fica

A vossa presen a ter  recompensa
Quando eu ocupar o meu trono
Injusti as farei com que parem
Preparados!


Preparados, Estamos preparados Para qu  


Para a morte do rei!

O Mufasa sempre imp s muitas restri  es no que toca   ca a
Quando eu for rei, os poderosos v o ser livres de levarem o que quiserem
Porque a barriga de uma hiena nunca est  cheia
O Mufasa   demasiado poderoso para se desafiar


O Mufasa   uma velha mensagem
J  foi um aplaudido regime
Os erros forjam a miragem
De um mundo repleto de crime
A era leonina est  de mudan a
E as hienas n o podem estar s s
  a minha vis o de abastan a
Tamb m inclui todos v s


Preparemos o crime deste s culo
Preparemos o golpe mais baixo
Bem premeditado
E bem calculado
Que um rei rejeitado
Ser  coroado
Por isso eu disputo
Por isso eu luto
Pelo trono que ter  de ser meu
Nem Mufasa, nem Simba, mas eu
Serei rei!

Hienas vulgares e infames, carentes de toda virtud. Pero guiadas por mi talento e ingenio, mi reino llegar  a su plenitud. 


Ya s  que no sois muy despiertos
No pod is razonar sin error
O d mi canci n muy atentos
No habr  un momento mejor
Ten is el instinto atrofiado
 No ol is a carro a real

Si fall is, ser  vuestro final
Preparad vuestro olfato de hienas
Pronto habr  novedades aqu 
Se acaba una era, la nueva os espera


 Y qu  papel es el nuestro 


O d al maestro
Ya s  que es odioso, mas soy generoso
Y yo siempre devuelvo un favor
En justicia soy todo un le n
Preparaos

Mufasa siempre ha mostrado demasiada contenci n a la hora de cazar
Cuando yo sea rey, los poderosos podr n servirse cuanto quieran
Pues el est mago de una hiena no est  nunca lleno
Mufasa tiene demasiado poder para retarle


Mufasa ya es agua pasada
Con un trasnochado poder
Su falta de mando presagia
El cambio que ansiamos ver
La era leonina ha cambiado
Por ende las hienas tambi n
Ya veo el futuro muy claro
Y est is a mi lado, lo s 


Preparad vuestro golpe de estado
Preparad vuestra risa voraz
Sed meticulosos
Y muy cautelosos
Ser is mi venganza
Mi gran esperanza
Un rey absoluto
Amado y astuto
Temido, glorioso y audaz
Ese trono es mi gran ambici n
 Preparaos!
Haven't you heard what's new
There is a rumour
Going around that suddenly I've found you
Better believe it's true
I got a feeling
This is for real and nobody else will do

You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
You are the one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess
Haven't you heard them say
I was a prisoner
Buried alive now suddenly I've been freed
But love is the sweetest way
Oh I was lonely
And now you're the only lover that I'll ever need

You are my princess
You make me smile
You make my life seem worthwhile
You are my princess
The only one
You make the sun shine on me
You're one fine lady
You're my princess
You're my princess
You're my princess
You're my princess

There was a little girl
Whose daddy called her queen
And life was filled with joy
Or that was how it seems
Her happiness she lost
A broken 
Abandoning her trust
And now daddy's not around


Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on


When she turns sixteen
A boyfriend called her his queen
A stimulating kiss, that felt like in a dream
Then after another dream
And after another 
Her body tells the tale
Of her unconsciousness


Oh, girl, you're a queen
Strong as anything
And when your think must gone
You still carry on
Oh, girl, you're a queen
If you just believe
And when your faith must gone
You still carry on
El Dorado, queen of cities
Paradise so wisely hid
Overshadows Barcelona
Aragon, Castile, Madrid
Where on Earth can match your riches
Match your people fine and free
Why return to old world values
This is how the Earth should be

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado, queen of cities
Overflowing with excess
Every turn exotic, lavish
Precious wonders numberless
Lead me now into temptation
Surely you would not deny
One who's come so far to find you
All your blessings save goodbye

El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado
El Dorado,  El Dorado, El Dorado, El Dorado

El Dorado, golden prison
Sheer perfection, sheer despair
How can one who knows such splendour
Feel the answer lies elsewhere
All I know is I must leave her
Or she'll be the death of me
Put my trust in poorer places
Let the queen of cities be

El Dorado,  El Dorado 
El Dorado,  El Dorado

El Dorado,  El Dorado
El Dorado,  El Dorado

Quem falou que   pecado usar paet

I'm sorry for everything I said
And for anything, I forgot to say, too
When things get so complicated
I stumble, at best, muddle through
I wish that our lives could be simple
I don't want the world, only you
I wish I could tell you this face to face
But there's never the time, never the place
So this letter will have to do
I love you
I know I'd go from rags to riches
If you would only say you care
And though my pockets may be empty
I'd be a millionaire, just like Elton, haha


My clothes may still be torn and tattered
But in my heart, I'd be king
Your love is all that ever mattered
It's everything


So open your arms and you'll open the door
To every treasure that I'm hoping for
Hold me and kiss me and tell me you're mine evermore


Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true 
Or will I go from rags to riches 
My fate is up to you




Must I forever be a beggar
Whose golden dreams will not come true 
Or will I go from rags to riches
My fate is up to you
If I could have my time again
I'd choose to love you just the same
I think of you and know it's true
You're not to blame, mhm...
Hurtin' me, you've made me find
I could see but still be blind
The change was meant, your love was lent
And truth was there for me to find, mhm...


Rainbow games, rainbow games

I never thought that I would see
The sun come shining out in me
But spring is here and now I know
Flowers need the rain to grow
The future's bright, I'm in the light
I'm at the way, and every day
Fresh winds blow, mhm...


Rainbow games, rainbow games
Rainbow games, rainbow games
Rainbow games, rainbow games
Rainbow games, rainbow games...
Has anybody here seen Razor Face 
I heard he's back, looking for a place, to lay down
Must be getting on
Needs a man who's young to walk him around
Needs a man who's young to walk him around


Oh, it must be hard for the likes of you
To get by in a world that you just can't see through
And it looks so cold
How does it feel to know you can't go home
How does it feel to know you can't go home


Come on, Razor Face, my old friend
I'll meet you down by the truck stop inn
With a bottle of booze in the back of my car
You're a song on the lips of an aging star
Razor Face, ooh! Amazing grace, protects you like a glove
And I'll never learn the reason why I love your Razor Face

I heard he's back, and looking for a place, to lay down

NoneNoneNone
Baby you're missing something in the air
I got a name but it don't matter
What's going on  It's cold in here
You have a life but it's torn and tattered
Maybe you're losing pieces of your heart
You have a world but it stopped turning
You lose the day and gain the dark
Love was a fire but it stopped burning


Spare your heart, save your soul
Don't drag your love across the coals
Find your feet and your fortune can be told
Release, relax, let go
And hey now let's recover your soul


Lazy old sunset sinking like a tear
Alone at night in a losing battle
That perfect world is never clear
You have to fight for the things that matter




Hey now let's recover
Hey now let's recover your soul
And hey now let's recover your soulI'm stoned in the twilight
Screaming on the inside
Give me your water, help me survive
Gonna miss the sunlight
When I lose my eyesight
Give me my red shoes, I want to dance
They search for an answer
But that old man wouldn't listen
Back then I was handsome
Back then he was ignorant
And shave off the years now, it's all inside my head
The boy in the red shoes is dancing by my bed
Put them in a box somewhere, put them in a drawer
Take my red shoes, I can't wear them anymore
Had garlands in the wings back then
All the pretty little things back then
Calling out my name, oh what fame brings
After curtain calls and bows
I can't see the front row now
Hand me my red shoes just one more time
They pushed aside our presence
They refused to go the distance
Back then I was Sigmund
Back then he wouldn't listen
Pretty little one
How has it all begun 
They're teaching you how to walk
But you're already on the run
Little one
What you gonna do 
Little one
Honey, it's all up to you


Now your daddy's in the den
Shootin' up the evening news
Mama's with a friend
Lately she's been so confused
Little one
Come on and take my hand
Well, I may not have the answer
But I believe I got a plan


Well honey you shake and I'll rattle
And we'll roll on down the line
And see if we can't get in touch
With a very close friend of mine
But let me clue you in, it ain't like him
To argue or pretend
Honey let me introduce you to my redneck friend

There's a picture in the nursery of a well known soldier man
And he wants to be like father when he grows up if he can
His eyes survey the floorboards with his soldiers around him
But fear not for the future, you will climb the highest mountain

So regimental sergeant zippo
Stand up to attention will you
Hear the bugle sounding in the morning call up rising
So your cowboy castle is standing
You're the one who is commanding
Watch them march along the landing down the stairs

Just a small boy in a small boy's world
And small boys do strange things
He likes to see the match sticks fly
And hear the cannons ring
For his eider down, his battle field
And in his dreams his fights are real
Until the field is won, aim, fire the guns

Well he could almost taste the money
But he was sitting in a den of thieves
Looking for the great awakening
Trying to find a way to leave
But that's when he got religion
And the light went on inside
He said somebody up there likes me
Now he's working for the holy guide
He got drunk but he don't remember
That he'd been drinking in a bar downtown
When he thought he heard a choir of angels
Singing in the Tiki Lounge
And that's when he got religion
From no salesman on TV
Just a tap on the shoulder in the parking lot
He still drinks but he does believe

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man

Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man


Well, she was silent as he paid her
But the thanks she got was next to none
And as her car pulled out of the motel
She felt the presence of someone

And that's when she got religion
In the front of a compact Ford
Just a gentle voice on the stereo 
Now she's a working girl who loves the lord


Religion
Oh, you do the best you can
We all make the same mistakes
We're gonna wind up with the man
I fell in love with you one September
Between the ashes and the dying embers
What happened to our dreams
Nothing so it seems
But I fell in love with you
Remember
If the phone forgets to ring this evening
And I'm left dazed and gazing at the ceiling
Be sure to understand
The future's in your hands
'Cause I'm still in love with you
Remember
I've loved enough to know
When I'm without a reason in hand
Oh there's little doubt
I've loved enough to be sure
I've loved enough to know the reason has gone
There's little doubt the season has gone
When I was young and so secure
I wrote to you of romance made in heaven
My words were touched with guilt, my sentences uneven
What happened to the line
I repeated time and time
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with you
I'm still in love with youTake every ray of sunshine from the sky
Let the rain fall, I don't care if the flowers die
The night lights can forget me
The stars will never glow
The days just seem so worthless
The hours, they come and go

Reminds me of you
Reminds me of you
The things we used to say
The things we used to do
All these happy hours are now just empty days
And I can't bear the strain to pass the time away
Reminds me of you

I see couples walking down the street
I watch them here
With tear filled eyes there's nothing left for me
For I just think about the times
That you and I were two
Crime sits heavy on the city shoulder
Can't get no work, I can't get a job
I just sit and play my radio in the parking lot
Well, they're breaking down doors in foreign countries
Everybody thinks somebody's hiding something
There's talk on the street, and the nation is worried
But you can't talk back when you're dead
When you're dead and buried


And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless


Everybody's scared, they think we're all in danger
Everyone's taking cover from someone else's anger
The walls have ears, Big Brother's watching
They tell us that we're poisoned from everything that we're touching


And everybody's restless
Everybody's scared
Everybody's looking for something that just ain't there
Everybody's restless
Everybody's restless
Hotel room I know you find
That you're just a bed and a chair
I look outside at the city streets
And I'm going to be a stranger out there
Call somebody I used to know
I'm pretty sure he should be at home
Operator said I got a line
But there doesn't seem to be any tone

Rest my head on a brand new bed
Came a long way today
Tomorrow morning I'll settle down
Tomorrow I'll be okay

Room service send me a room
One with a friend and a view
Gonna put on a gown and head for town
Have a little rendevous
Small time girl it's a big time town
You must of heard this story before
Got to find a way to make the whole thing pay
I don't want to stay in line anymore

Momma said I oughta be at home
A needle don't belong in the hay
Tomorrow morning I'll settle down
Tomorrow I'll be okay

It's paradise here where the sun meets the sea
There's nothing to fear and so much to be
But soon I must go, say goodbye to it all
That homeland of mine is beginning to call


Goodbye doesn't mean this has to be the end
Fading dreams grow cold as ice
And I got a feeling we will meet again
When we return to paradise


The wind in our hair and the sun in our eyes
There's no need for tears and no time for lies
So reach out your hand and I'll reach out my heart
Remember me while we are apart




I'm heading homeward
Leaving sunshine and heading for rain
But we'll return to paradise againNone
If anyone should see me making it down the highway
Breaking all the laws of the land
Well, don't you try to stop me, I'm going her way
And that's the way I'm sure she had it planned


Well, that's my rock and roll Madonna
She's always been a lady of the road
Well, everybody wants her, and no one ever gets her
Well, the freeway is the only way she knows


Well, if she would only slow down for a short time
I'd get to know her just before she leaves
But she's got some fascination for that two-wheel combination
And I swear it's gonna be the death of me

So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock m  when he's gone

Br ak the bread in two and you can give me half
I've ridden hard and fast just to make you laugh
To make you laugh, I've stood knee-deep in mud outside your door
Clutching in my hand a border rose from Baltimore


Lady, that's the way you've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other and we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock me when he's gone
I said, lady, that's the way you've gotta rock me when he's gone
You make me feel like a diesel train going home
We got so much to give each other and we've only just begun
So take me baby, break me lady, gotta rock me when he's gone


Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me, rock me when he's gone
Come on and rock me, come on and rock me
Come on and rock me when he's gone
Alright!

Everybody's been talkin' about

Gonna start after midnight
And rock it til the break of dawn
Gonna start after midnight

Ya don't have to be a saint

We're gonna rock, gonna rock, rock this house
We're gonna rock, gonna rock, rock this house
We're gonna rock, rock this house ... tonight
Music by elton john
Never released

I've served upon this railroad for longer than i know
My father and his father did the same thing long ago
To keep the western union rolling down towards the sea
The benefits of this great line built for you and me

So rolling western union, you can roll on to the sea
Ten thousand miles of beatin' steel has made a man out of me
In every state i've driven home a rivet with my hands
Oh it's rolling western union rolling onward, onward through our land

It's friends of mine who died upon the building of this line
Irishmen and chinamen and some from the british isles
I've even seen the convicts come to work here for a while
Before the law caught up with them and sent them back to trial

I had a wife while on the job a hundred miles on back
She died in oklahoma and i laid her by the track
All that's left is a wooden cross upright on a mound
And every time the train rolls past, it rumbles in the groundNoneNoneI don't make the rules around here
A tear starts at the edge
It takes two hands to rip it
It takes a lot more than either one of us has said

But I come from indecision
A place you ain't never been
Living in the state of confusion
On a map that runs like the veins under your skin

We got Miss Communication kicking out the stool
We got mass determination making up the rules
But saving us is something that we can't do
And it's easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool

And love is just another means
By which we hang ourselves
It takes two to execute
One to leave with innocence and one to leave with guilt

But I just see no reality
Just shades drawn on remorse
We've whipped this beast beyond the limit
Staggered out of breath along this course

It's easier to lose a rope around a fool
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
A ring of your indifference thrown anywhere you choose
Easier sometimes to throw a rope around a fool
We've moved on six miles from where we were yesterday
And yesterday is but a long, long ways away
So we'll camp out tonight beneath the bright starlight
And forget rotten peaches and the places we've stayed


I left from the dockland two years ago now
Made my way over on the S.S. Marie
And I've always had trouble wherever I've settled
Rotten peaches are all that I see

Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun


Mercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun


There ain't no green grass in a U.S. state prison
There is no one to hold when you're sick for your wife
And each day out you'll pick, you'll pick rotten peaches
You'll pick rotten peaches for the rest of your life


Oh, I've had me my fill of cocaine and pills
For I lie in the light of the Lord
And my home is ten thousand, ten thousand miles away
And I guess I won't see it no more


Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy, I'm a criminal, Jesus, I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Seems I've seen that devil fruit since the world begun
Mercy, I'm a criminal
Jesus, I'm the, Jesus, I'm the one
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun
Rotten peaches, rotting in the sun

Sometimes you dream, sometimes it seems
There's nothing there at all
You just seem older than yesterday
And you're waiting for tomorrow to call
You draw to the curtains and one thing's for certain
You're cozy in your little room
The carpet's all paid for, God bless the TV
Let's go shoot a hole in the moon


Oh, and Roy Rogers is riding tonight
Returning to our silver screens
Comic book characters never grow old
Evergreen heroes whose stories were told
Oh, the great sequin cowboy who sings of the plains
Of roundups and rustlers and home on the range
Turn on the TV, shut out the lights
Roy Rogers is riding tonight


Nine o'clock mornings, five o'clock evenings
I'd liven the pace if I could
Oh, I'd rather have a ham in my sandwich than cheese
But complaining wouldn't do any good
Lay back in my armchair, close eyes and think clear
I can hear hoof-beats ahead
Roy and Trigger have just hit the hilltop
While the wife and the kids are in bed

Roy Rogers is riding tonightYou know Dasher and Dancer
And Prancer and Vixen
Comet and Cupid

But do you recall
The most famous reindeer of all 
Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

Had a very shiny nose

And if you ever saw it

You would even say it glows

All of the other reindeer

Used to laugh and call him names

They never let poor Rudolph

Play in any reindeer games

Then one foggy Christmas Eve
Santa came to say

Rudolph with your nose so bright
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight 
Then all the reindeer loved him

And they shouted out with glee

"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer

You'll go down in history!"




You might think you've peeped the scene
You haven't, the real one's far too mean
The watered-down one, the one you know
Was made up centuries ago
They made it sound all wack and corny
Yes, it's awful blasted boring
Twisted fictions, sick addiction
Well, gather 'round, children, zip it, listen

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I fantasized 'bout this back in Chicago
Mercy, mercy me, that Murci lago
That's me the first year that I blow
How you say broke in Spanish  Mi no hablo
Me drown sorrow in that Diablo
Me found bravery in my bravado
DJs need to listen to the models
You ain't got no fuckin' Yeezy in your Serato  
Stupid, but what the hell do I know 
I'm just a Chi-Town nigga with a Nas flow
And my bitch in that new Phoebe Philo
So much head, I woke up to Sleepy Hollow


Can we get much higher  
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh 


Oooh!
Look like a fat booty Celine Dion
Sex is on fire, I'm the King of Leona Lewis
Beyond the truest
Hey, teacher, teacher, tell me how do you respond to students 
And refresh the page and restart the memory 
Re-spark the soul and rebuild the energy 
We stopped the ignorance, we killed the enemy
Sorry for the night demons that still visit me
The plan was to drink until the pain over
But what's worse, the pain or the hangover 
Fresh air, rollin' down the window
Too many Urkels on your team, that's why your wins low
Don't make me pull the toys out, huh
Don't make me pull the toys
And fire up the engines
And then they make noise

There's a hungry road I can only hope's
Gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit coming clean
In the eye of a lifelong fire
Tell Monday I'll be around next week
I'm running ahead of my days
In the shotgun chance that scattered us
I've seen the error of my ways
Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns
Like sun gods spitting rain
Found a way home written on this map
Like red dye in my veins
In the hardest times that come around
The fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down
It's a darkness no one knows


And I've poured out the pleasure and dealt with the pain
Standing in a station waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little muscle again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Oh I'm out of control and out of my hands
I'm tearing like a demon through no man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway trainThere's a hungry road, like my lonely hopes, gonna eat me up inside
There's a drifting spirit, coming clean, in the eye of a life born of fire
Tell Monday I'll be round next week, I'm running ahead of my days
In this shotgun chance, that's scared of us, I've seen the error of my ways

Oh-oh
Woooh-oh

Well we've wrapped ourselves in golden crowns, like sungods spitting rain
Found the way home written on this map, like red dye in my veins
And the hardest of times that come around, the fear of losing grows
I've lost and seen the world shut down, it's a dark lesson no-one knows


And I've poured out the pleasure, and dealt with the pain
I'm standing in the station, waiting in the rain
I'm starting to feel a little morsel again
But love is lost like a runaway train
Well I'm out of control, and out of my head
I'm tearing like a demon in no-man's land
Trying to get a grip on my life again
Nothing hits harder than a runaway train



Oh-oh
Mmmmm-mmm

You figured it out, the trick to the game
You made the fires bloom and got me so drawn to the flames that I changed
It s true, midnight and you, you re the same
You come to me once a day
And every time that I ask you why, you say cos you know just what it takes



So when the night falls and my mind drifts into space and I know that I m dreaming
Even that can t take away your hand from my shoulder
You found a way to keep me running back to you, to keep me running back to you


You figured it out didn t you  I felt you re-write the rules
I felt every inch of the flames burn your name
It s true, the oceans and me, we re the same. We both come in waves, but you
You learned how to sail these blues until they welcome you and you say you know just what it takes



So when the night falls and my mind drifts into space and I know that I m dreaming
Even that can t take away your hand from my shoulder
You find a way to keep me running back to you, to keep me running back to you
When I m at my limit, when I m at the point where I might say
 Gotta pull my heart out, I need to keep some space. Gotta keep some distance 
You find a way to keep me running back to you, to keep me running back to you

I used to know this old scarecrow
My joy and sorrow
Cast alone between the furrows
No longer sown by anyone
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Beneath these branches
I once wrote such childish words for you
I held a dandelion
When summer burned the earth again

Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad


No longer sown by anyone


Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad, so sad
Sad
I guess there are times when we all need to share a little pain
And ironing out the rough spots
Is the hardest part when memories remain
And it's times like these when we all need to hear the radio
'Cause from the lips of some old singer
We can share the troubles we already know


Turn 'em on, turn 'em on
Turn on those sad songs
When all hope is gone
Why don't you tune in and turn them on 

They reach into your room, oh
Just feel their gentle touch
When all hope is gone
Sad songs say so much


If someone else is suffering enough, oh, to write it down
When every single word makes sense
Then it's easier to have those songs around
The kick inside is in the line that finally gets to you
And it feels so good to hurt so bad
And suffer just enough to sing the blues

When stars are born
Are they cast out
To wander cold and lonely, lost in space 

A loveless point of light
That can't return
Forever fixed within one place

When love is lost
And dreams are cast
Like bruised and battered pieces left to die

When hands that reach out
Are betrayed
How can my tortured soul survive 

There's only one thing left
And that's the one thing that you needed most of all
For the freedom that you gain
Is the loss that led you aimless to the shore

And I'm borne high on these waves
Swept by the wind and alone
Oh, sail me away
Carry me back to my home

I viewed in my presence
My hand on my forehead
And sighting the liners
Of mad merchant seamen
In search of the living
Or the spices of China
Lucy walked gently
Between the damp barrels
And shut out my eyes
With the width of her fingers
Said she'd guessed the number
Of bales in the back room

While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails


Lucy I said
In a passage of cotton kegs
Can we hold hands
I'm sure that it's warmer
Then the gulls ate the crumbs
Of Lucy's sandwich


While the seagulls were screaming
Lucy was eating
Then we hauled up our colours
The way the mother had told us
And together we just watched the sails
You don't pass your time in limbo
Or hang out with the crowd
Sitting on the stoop like a little girl
Who took the wrong road into town
But you got that short cut way about you
And no one's going to stare you down
You cook much better on a lower flame
You burn much better when the sun goes down


And heaven can wait
But you ought to be a saint
I got your very best intentions
Helping me along
And if I ever fail to mention
You were an overnight sensation
Well take it from me
My baby's a saint 


I believe you were a new arrival
On the fast train passing through
And you traded in your luck for survival
To sweeten up the witch's brew
You had a better way of working magic
A little mystery in your eyes
Instead of rolling over you remained the same
You took the whole world by surprise

I have to say, my friends
This road goes a long, long way
And if we're going to find the end
We're going to need a helping hand
I have to say, my friends
We're looking for a light ahead
In the distance, a candle burns
Salvation keeps the hungry children fed


It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation

A chance to put the devil down
Without the fear of hell
Salvation spreads the gospel 'round
And free you from yourself




It's gotta take a lot of salvation
What we need are willing hands
You must feel the sweat in your eyes
You must understand salvation
NoneNoneNoneJust got the price in my pocket for a one course meal
My shoes are tilting over to an angle at the heel
I should be feeling sorry for myself and I may
But I've got a little happiness, I know she's gone away

Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To take away my suffering and pain
Sara's coming back to me, yes she is
To show me that the good times will be here once again

She's got the face of an angel and a heart made of gold
She's got me feeling like a spy that came in from the cold
Now I can shout about it, that's the way that I feel
'Cause Sara's coming back to me, she's coming back for real

Now I know that I wasn't very kind to her before
'Cause I was staying out at night, I guess it made her sore
And there were times that I thought she'd left me for good
But she wrote to me this morning, and she said she never could
You've a certain sartorial eloquence
And a style that's almost of your own
You've got the knack of being so laid-back
It's like talking to the great Unknown
You've got a self-sufficient swept-back hairdo
Pretty certain that you've got it made
Oh your life-style shows in the clothes you chose
Sitting pretty in the masquerade


Sing it
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more
Don't you want to play this game no more
Don't you want to play no more

You remain the only main contender
Though you never, you never meant to lose at all
Down at the mouth yet unsurrounded
Adamant before the fall
Though when you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control
Go and get your kicks and babe let's call it quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed


Don't you want to play this game no more
When you go you know I might be lonesome
But I'll keep it under close control

Go and get your kicks and babe, let's call that quits
I believe I'm feeling indisposed, sing it

Well you come on like a comet, ideas in your head
Starving for affection, waiting to be fed
Crazy like a full moon, eyes open wide
Taking in everything you need to stay alive


Who leads who, who knows where
If you leave me now will I see you again


I'm telling you love bites
Like a satellite
Going round and round
It's something, something you can't fight
Oh in the daylight
And even in the dark night
I want you to surround me
Surround me like a satellite

Oh you move like a shadow of your own design
Do you want to trap me in between the lines
I don't walk on water if you think I can
If you want a miracle call up a Superman






Are we there
Is this love
Is this a space race
That we're both part of

Saturday sun came early one morning
In a sky so clear, clear and blue
But Saturday sun, it came without warning
So no one knew what to do

And saturday sun brought people and places
That didn't see much in their day
And when I remember these people, these people and places
They were really, really too good in their way, in their way

And saturday sun won't come and see me today
Think about stories with reason and rhyme
Circling through, through your brain
Just think about, think about people
In their season, season and times
Just returning again and again

So Sunday sat in Saturday sun
And wait for a day gone by
Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Come and sing and dance to sausage rolls with me
Here we go, we are back
Trying to make history for charity
And may I introduce to you
Ed Sheeran and Sir Elton John
No pressure

]
Let s have a party, it's Christmas Day
Your mum's cooking turkey but been moanin  since yesterday
The presents are open and the bin bags are put away
Just until Boxing Day



Get to the kitchen for sausage rolls
Kids, drop your toys and dance along to rock and roll
Everyone's here, and now the dog's got th  trifle bowl
This is pure family goals
Let's sing, M rry Christmas 


The sausage rolls are on 
And our family are back, joined as one
Ooh, we're havin' so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the kids who have none 
Sausage rolls for everyone

Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever
I need more dreams and less life
I need that dark in a little more light
I cried tears you'll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean, and leave me be
You are what you love, not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes', I'm here to scream
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll 
No, no , wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll 
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever

You're too low to see me smiling
When I'm flying in the air
But you're too high to frighten me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me
Pretend you didn't see me
Pretend you didn't need me


To frighten away all the lost and the lonely
The sacred forgotten of yesterday's problems
Your wooden construction was meant for infliction
To penetrate pain with the thoughts from my mind

Can you see me, scarecrow 
Can you still feel free 
For all your love, scarecrow
And will you still be there tomorrow 
And will you still be there tomorrow 


Like moths around a light bulb, your brain is still bleeding
From visions and pictures of nature's young raincoat
If only my eyes were not pinned to your table
My arms would be grasping the lilac of summer 
It's no good to me, a scarecrow can't see
I've said it before, and I'll say it some more


You're too low to see me smiling
When I'm flying in the air
But you're too high to frighten me


Can you see me, scarecrow 
Can you still feel free 
For all your love, scarecrow 
And will you still be there tomorrow 
And will you still be there tomorrow 
And will you still be there tomorrow 
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go 
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close 
Should have known you were lonely


I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else 
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left 
They just made you feel lonely 
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart

When I was a boy I had a lot of fun
I lived by the sea, I was a fisherman's son
My mother she was a fisherman's wife
She was scrubbing floors most of her life

They said screw you
I ain't got nothing to lose
I could paper a matchbox
With the money I use

At the school I attended I got into fights
I was beaten in an alley on a cold winter night
The teachers cared less for the blood in our veins
They got most of their thrills out of using a cane

They said screw you
Oh you bloody young fools
I could get more sense
Out of the back end of a mule

So you see there's man who get paid for being slaves
And men who get paid for being free
And there's men behind bars who pray for the light
And men in the suburbs who pray for the night
And they're all trying to climb to the top of the mine
And all of them say most of the way
Screw you

Out there there's not a sound to be heard

As the waters freeze up with the summer's end

Mas prestem aten  o com paci ncia
Nas minhas palavras preciosas

Pois quero que fiquem cientes
Que quando um rei sai outro entra
E   raz o para ficarem contentes

Uma vida sensacional

  Mufasa sempre mostrou muitas restri  es quando se trata de ca ar. Quando eu for rei, os poderosos tomar o tudo que quiserem, porque as hienas t m barrigas que nunca enchem


  Mufasa   poderoso demais pra ser desafiado

E juntos iremos vencer

Se preparem para o golpe do s culo

Dad 
Dad, come on
You gotta get up
Dad
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Get up, get up, get up, get up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up

Ooh baby, now let's get down tonight


There's a calm surrender to the rush of day
When the heat of a rolling wind can be turned away
An enchanted moment, and it sees me through
It's enough for this restless warrior just to be with you

And can you feel the love tonight 
It is where we are

It's enough for this wide-eyed wanderer
That we got this far



Lady luck and four leaf clovers
Won't ease this hurt I feel all over
My life was one special occasion
Until your leaving dampened the situation


Well well well
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down
Standing on shakey ground
Ever since you put me down


My car got repossessed this morning
Harder times I haven't seen in years
Girl you better throw me a life preserver
Because I'm about to drown in my own tears


She's a little explosion of hope
Never turns the lights down low, she can go there if you want to though
There are no markings on her country roads
No signs that show the way back home
When you get there you won't wanna go


I ve frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her

She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I m burning yeah I m burning
I m burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I m melting darling, I can t let go


She likes to lay under the covers though
Pretending everywhere s our home
Keeps me warm right to my very soul
We get so tangled up it's hard to know
What is hers and what s my own
Vines at the bottom of an olive grove


I ve frozen all my desire
Covered up in virgin snow
But when I stand beside her


She burns yeah she burns
Like petrol soaked paper and fireworks
And I m burning yeah I m burning
I m burning so deep that just breathing hurts
I m melting darling, I can t let go
I m melting darling, I can t let go
I m melting darling, I can t let go
Maybe, you're always maybe
Maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe
Maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side

She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side

She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day
She sold me magic
She sold me magic
And all the believer things I needed every day

She said I'm in my better life time
She said my soul is matching her a sign
She turn mine in all about she loves me strong
Will you love me love  She push me all again your love
Will you love me love  She push me all again your love

Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
My thanks jaunty for the lower time
Maybe, you're always maybe, maybe, maybe I love you
But I keep follow something other side
Mornin' girls!


Mornin' Mrs. Wilkinson!


Oi, Rocky, Booger off
Music, Maestro, please
Arms!

Arms!


She's a right old cow


Ay, that's me mum!


Full plie!


Full plie!


Your mum 


Yeah


And up!


And up!

Oh my love
I have cursed the stars above
That lead my heart to you
But as hard as I try
Still my love will not die
And the stars still shine on through 


Oh my dear
Now this ship's too hard to steer
The tide has turned, turned on you
I have been through the lies
That I've seen in your eyes
But the truth still shines on through
But the truth it still shines, shines on through

So shine, shine on through the days we have to fill
Though we took our love so daringly
And gave it up uncaringly
There are feelings left not even we can kill


Oh my friend
So at last we reach the end
The lights go down on cue
I have wasted my time
But it tasted oh so fine
That my love still shines, shines on through
And my love still shines, shines on you
Oh no I don't want it
You can take it all
I'll put my money where my mouth is
Put your suitcase in the hall
Oh you robbed me blind
Of what little hope remained
You put a gun to my head
A bullet through my brain


You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains
You can't shoot down the moon
Some things never change
We can build a bridge between us
But the empty space remains


Just as long as you're around
We live on borrowed time
I'll put my money where my mouth is
You're guilty at the scene of the crime
I never say more than I need
The mystery runs deep
The dangers buried below
The secrets that you keep

I'm still in love with you, oh, shooting star
And when I start to wonder where you are
There you are, there you are, shooting star
You may have seen me at the early show
I sat and watched you from the second row
Oh, you were mine long ago way back when
Even then we both knew you'd go far, oh, shooting star
And with the spotlight shining in your eyes
It's sometimes hard to find your way
But maybe some night you might
Think of me, shooting star
And when that moment comes at last
And you remember who you are


Here I'll be, shooting star, shooting star
Now, it was just like Frankie and Johnny
And it was just like Stagger Lee
Dolly Summers was a simple girl
From a midwest family
With a stucco home and her own Mustang
And a charge account at Sears
Well, she had everything that a girl could want
To live happy for the rest of her years 


But the thing that she wanted most of all
Was the thing that she had lost
To the arms of a downtown blackjack hustler
By the name of Candyfloss
They'd skipped town on a late night train
Heading for the west
Oh, Dolly slipped behind the wheel of her Mustang
With a piece between her breast

She put a pistol in her shoulder holster
She took her car up from Santa Fe
Yesterday morning she was washing dishes
Now she's hunting down a runaway
Don't judge a man by a misdemeanor
You may be sorry when his light goes out
Don't put that pistol in your shoulder holster
Oh, you can never, never tell if the law's about 


If it seemed just like a movie
Or a night of bad TV
They should have had a picture of Dolly's face
As she drove across country
With daggers drawn for her fallen man
And venom in her heart
It was nearly dawn when she caught them up
Making out in a picnic park


But the thing that shook her rigid
As she fumbled for her gun
Was the state of the man that she'd married once
And thought of as the only one
And as she looked back on the chances
That she'd passed up at home
Well, she quietly dumped her pistol in a ditch
And she headed home alone
Ooh she said, "The crowd just loved you
My name's Angel and I'm sixteen
I really love your band and your funny accent
Sure would like a cruise in your limousine."

Then she said, "How about a rubdown 
You're so cute and I'm so mean
The way you hold your guitar really gets me
I can show you tricks that you ain't never seen."

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City
"Hey man, how's about a handout
All you dudes just loaded down
Just a little sugar man, makes me sweeter
I like to sit at home and watch the world go 'round."

Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh, Sick City

Stage door monkey's on my back
Begging me to save his life
Can't he understand we're not a healing show
We're just here to play some music for the kids tonight

Sick City, nobody to love you
Oh but sometimes I can taste you when I'm feeling weak
Sick City, isn't it a pity
That you can't float above it when the bottom leaks
Oh oh, Sick City

Say goodbye to Oz and everything you own
California dreamin' is a Pettibon
LA's screaming you're my home
Vanity is blasted but it's rarely fair
I could smell the Prozac in your pretty hair
Got a lot of friends, but is anyone there
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home
Stick n move you're living in a quick world
Got a heavy life for such a tiny girl
Born into it that's for sure

Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche


People talk and tell you what you want to hear
Do you really need another souvenir
Superheroes tend to disappear
Fame is just a trick you see an empty glass
Leave you feeling thirsty and so very fast
Chase your tail, my baby, it'll be your last
I don't know but it's been said
Your heart is stronger than your head
And this location is my home


Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche




Rivers get connected so much stronger than expected well
Sick love comes to wash us away, yeah
Prisons of perspective, how your vision gets corrected and
Sick love is my modern cliche
Like a fool I went and stayed too long
Now I'm wondering if your love's still strong
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Then that time I went and said goodbye
Now I'm back and not ashamed to cry
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours


I've done a lot of foolish things
That I really didn't mean, didn't I 

Seen a lot of things in this old world
When I touch them, they mean nothing, girl
Oo, baby, here I am, signed, sealed, delivered, I'm yours!

Oowee baby, you set my soul on fire
That's why I know you're my heart's only desire

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

Here I am baby
Signed, Sealed, Delivered, I'm yours

There's a breakdown on the runway
And the timeless flights are gone
I'm a year ahead of myself these days
And I'm locomotive strong
My city spread like cannon fire
In a yellow nervous state
I can't cut the ties that bind me
To horoscopes and fate


And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again

When we break out of this blindfold
I'm gonna take you from this place
Until we're free from this ball and chain
I'm still hard behind the eight
My city beats like hammered steel
On a shallow cruel rock
If we could walk proud after midnight
We'd never have to stop


And I won't break and I won't bend
But someday soon we'll sail away
To innocence and the bitter end
And I won't break and I won't bend
And with the last breath we ever take
We're going to get back to the simple life again
As an old man, I'm a young man
'Cause I've not been old for long
And before these trembling waters settle
I'll have flown the pond
So I don't mean to be morbid
Or a bit too on the nose
But I'd like to share a few things
That I've learned along the road


What you'll find chasing dreams
Is the finish line recedes
And a riddle stays a riddle
Oh, the humor's bittersweet

All nature does is dance
So when you dance, you're in accord
Look no further than the feeling
That it gives you for reward
Reward 
Reward
Reward 


Simple things
Hard to learn
Fire is hot
Burn, burn, burn
Simple truth
Hard to see
Not what you want
But what you need 
Mmm-mmm


I've been a sleepwalker, a cheap talker
A sly grin, a discreet offer
I've held steady for a gaze
I've led a lover through a maze
I've thrown bottles at the wall
When someone forgot to call
I've done all the things a wild heart will do
I will do

The mother of invention made it good for me
Tighter in the rear
Longer in the seam
Kicked out yards of leather
Wrapped around her waist
Trimmed it to perfection
And left a little space
Yeah they got competition now
All across the world
But there hasn't been no looking back
Since God invented girls


Now I know what Brian Wilson meant
Every time I step outside
I see what Heaven sent
There may be seven wonders
Created for this world
But one is all we need
Since God invented girls


Higher on the heel, paler than pure cream
Leaner on the sidewalk
Cutting through the steam
After claws and feathers
He took skin and bone
Shaped it like an hourglass
And made the angels moan
Oh here's a little heat boys
To straighten out them curls
Now there haven't been no angels round
Since God invented girls

When I was young, I prayed for lightning
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning


Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing


I heard one sine from above 
I heard one sine from above 
Then the signal split in two
The sound created stars like me and you
Before there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine


Healed my heart, heard a sine
Healed my heart, heard a sine

When I was young, I prayed for lightning
My mother said it would come and find me
I found myself without a prayer
I lost my love and no one cared
When I was young, I prayed for lightning


Yeah, I looked with my face up to the sky
But I saw nothing there, no, no, nothing there
Yeah, I stared while my eyes filled up with tears
But there was nothing there, no, no, nothing


I heard one sine from above 
I heard one sine from above 
Then the signal split in two
The sound cr ated stars like me and you
B fore there was love, there was silence
I heard one sine
And it healed my heart, heard a sine


I heard one sine


When I was young, I felt immortal
And not a day went by without a struggle
I lived my days just for the nights
I lost myself under the lights
When I was young, I felt immortal

Though you feel at times you just can't win
Sing, sing children, sing
That you give is known, so don't give in
Sing, sing children, sing


Sing of the true way, sing of the time
Show them the new way, let your light shine


He who lights the fire, must surely burn
Turn, turn children, turn
From the ones who see, but will not learn
Turn, turn children, turn


Turn from the darkness, turn all the way
Look for the sunshine   then don't turn away


For everyone who doesn't stand, must fall
Call, call children, call
And he who finds himself, then finds us all
Call, call children, call
I know you
You're trying to do all you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Girl I can do without you
Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then I'd be finished for good
So sing me no sad songs, tell me no lies
Please don't you make me blue

I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come, but my need is none
And I want to be alone with myself

There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So darling please don't you comfort me
I know you, you're trying to do
All you can for me
I appreciate your help
But it's best just to leave me be


There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So, darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue
Sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Girl, I can do without you
Don't go breaking my heart
It would tear me apart
'Cause then, I'd be finished for good
So, sing me no sad songs
Tell me no lies
Please, don't you make me blue


I don't want you to think I'm mean
Refusing all your help
The time has come but, my need is none
And I wanna be alone with myself


There's many things that I have done
And I'm sorry for them now
So, darling please don't you comfort me
I'll sort it out somehow

The old gates are always locked
By the daughter of the keys
Sad eyes are fixed on the world
From the balcony
While the six o'clock procession
Take their prayer books to the hall
It's sad to see them shed a tear
Inside the convent walls


Red mountains around them
Keep out those who'd come
But only birds and wild deer
Share the lives of nuns
For ladies who in kindness
Burn the knowledge they have found
Their knowledge lies inside a hole
Buried in the ground

For the Sisters of the Cross
Seek the shadows that they have lost
In the walls where their lives
Are protected by God
But the feeling of love
Is somewhere in your bones
Your body is wasted
When it should have been owned


The Mother of the mission bells
Has lived here all her life
She never felt the hands of a man
Touch her in the night
And the canopies that cover her
So cold and so afraid
Thinking holy mothers die
Like spinsters in the grave


To be single in the chapel
Praying knelt down on your knees
Where the corridors are echoing
Their proud solemnity
And the candlelight against the glass
Plays shadow chasing tricks
As the young girls fall, their eyes in tears
Beside the crucifix
I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
People tell me I'm just lazy
Weather or not it's true I don't know

So I'm just sitting doing nothing
Wondering where I should go
Many people that I've encountered
Say they wish that they were free

And I know that secretly
All those people would really like to be me

So even though they tell me I'm idle
Why should I do what they say
For they're in the same place all the time
But I'm only there for a day

So I'm just sitting doing nothingNoneNoneWho'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age 
When the ragged dog they gave me has been ten years in the grave
Se orita plays guitar, and plays it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

You've hung up your grey coat and you've laid down your gun
You know the war you fought in wasn't too much fun
Ah the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on

Yes, I'll sit with you and talk, let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayer would be very much the same
Magdalena plays the organ, plays it just for you
My rosary has broken and my beads have all slipped through

Who'll walk me down to church when I'm sixty years of age

Yes, I'll sit with you and talk, let your eyes relive again
I know my vintage prayers would be very much the same
And Magdelena plays the organ, plays it just for you
Your choral lamp that burns so low when you are passing through

And the future you're giving me holds nothing for a gun
I've no wish to be living sixty years on
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway


For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinking of the way that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey


For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
Fly away again


Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you've left so very far behind
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway
For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors
Of the world outside
Thinking of the way
That the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn
From purple into grey
For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreaming of the open
Waiting for the day
He can spread his wings
And fly away again
Fly away skyline pigeon fly
Towards the dreams
You've left so very far behind
Just let me wake up in the morning
To the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die
In the brightness of my day
I want to hear the pealing bells
Of distant churches sing
But most of all please free me
From this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sunNone
Turn me loose from your hands
Let me fly to distant lands
Over green fields, trees and mountains
Flowers and forest fountains
Home along the lanes of the skyway


For this dark and lonely room
Projects a shadow cast in gloom
And my eyes are mirrors of the world outside
Thinkin' of the ways that the wind can turn the tide
And these shadows turn from purple into grey

For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again


Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind
Fly away, skyline pigeon, fly
Towards the dreams you left so very far behind


Let me wake up in the mornin' to the smell of new mown hay
To laugh and cry, to live and die in the brightness of my day
I wanna hear the pealing bells of distant churches sing
But most of all, please free me from this aching metal ring
And open out this cage towards the sun


For just a Skyline Pigeon
Dreamin' of the open
Waiting for the day
That he can spread his wings
And fly away again

There's a river running sweat right through our land, through our land
Driven by a man with a bullwhip in his hand, in his hand
And I've taken just as much as I can stand, I can stand
Oh, we've got to free our brothers from their shackles, yeah, if we can, if we can


Most nights I have to watch my woman cry, oh, she cries
Every day I watch the colonel smile, oh, he smiles
His painted ladies riding in from town, in from town
Oh, I swear one day I'm gonna burn the whorehouse to the ground, to the ground

Slave, slave
To fight the violence we must be brave
Hold on strong to the love God gave
Slave


There's a rumor of a war that's yet to come, yet to come
That may free our families, free our families and our sons, and our sons
It may lay green lands to barren waste, all to waste, all to waste
Oh, the price of release is a bitter blow to face, oh, to face

Like a thief he's come, like a thief he's gone
He's stolen your tears one by one
You're proud to love him, it's a foolish sign
You're a broken heart at the scene of the crime
And the night drags on, and the fever burns
Come to your senses, everybody learns
You sleep in sweet fire lost and blue
You're an empty doll in the power of a fool

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

If it looks like rain, if it makes no sound
It's an echo of pain on common ground
Love's like a junkie, addiction's a fact
Passion's a monkey you can't keep off your back

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between

But he takes love and he turns it cold
He's just an iceman honey, ain't got no heart of gold
But he sees you and he runs from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to
And he'll hurt you
And he'll run from you
Come on and shake this shadow that you're clinging to

Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go praying he'll come back
Take a deep breath and deny
You could love a man like that
Don't go sleeping with the past
Don't go waking with a dream
There's no tenderness that's left
In the cracks you step between
Hey there, Georgie
Got a couple of things to say
One, you're my friend, and two, it's hurting me
Seeing you act this way
But my hands are tied and I can only try
To talk you out of a fall
'Cause the reputation of the woman you're dating's
About as nasty as the Berlin wall


Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Oh, man, you've gotta watch yourself
She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorc e
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh

You better cut her loose
Before she gets her hooks in you
If you gave her the world and it was covered in pearls
She'd only ask for the moon
She's got you hypnotized with her big brown eyes
And her body that could stop a clock
But if you think your face ain't gonna be replaced
Georgie, boy, you're in for a shock


Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
Oh, man, you've gotta watch yourself
She's gonna get in your head, she's gonna crawl in your bed
You're just a stepping stone for someone else
Slow down, Georgie, she's poison
She's just another divorc e
An undercover lover of a hundred other little fish in the sea
Oh, oh, oh, oh


Well, it ain't my job to rain on your parade
But if the chips were down you'd do the same for me
It's always been that way
She's got you paralyzed with a pack of lies
About honor and the single girl
And if you buy that line, you must be out of your mind
You must be living in another world

The weather man he looks confused
Shakes his fist at the sky like you used to do
But you don't remember things like that do you
The balance was uneven but I'm breaking through
Slow rivers run cold
Shallow waters never sank so low
I thought I'd drown and you'd never know
You're a slow river and you run so cold
The winter here don't believe in God
The bitter wind just bites through me like a wild dog
I still see your eyes tonight like headlights through the fog
But one foot in your door oh that's all I ever got
Chances are you'll reappear
Swim my way in a flood of tears
No place to hide your conscience so
You're a sinking ship with no place to goThe weather man, he looks confused

Who'd ever guess you'd come across a snake in the grass

Every day now, ahh
You take a walk here, ahh
What do you say now, ahh
If you should meet an evil-minded snake in the grass

Stop and watch where you're putting your feet, my sweet
I don't want to do anything bad
But you make me mad and I might bite your face, bite neck, bite arms, bite bite
'Cause I'm, oh, a snake in the grass, oh
A snake in the grass

Looking around you, ahh
You never see me, ahh
You'll get a surprise, ahh
Should you get entangled with a snake in the grass

I can be lonely, ahh
Please can I come in, ahh
And end my sad existence as a snake in the grass

I was born in the north of England
I was raised in a working town
I broke all the rules when I went to school
But the teacher's couldn't pin me down
I tried to make my parents proud
By adapting to the social powers
Oh, pigs will fly and the Earth will fry
When they get me doing honest hours

Snookeroo, Snookeroo
Daddy's going on the booze
Mother used to cut my hair
And sister used to make the news
Well, it was two rooms up and two rooms down
We were sentenced by the wrecking crane
Oh, I was born on the eve of Halloween
And Snookeroo, Snookeroo
Snookeroo's my name


I need someone to cook for me
And turn me lose at night
I could spend my life with a factory girl
'Cause a factory girl's my type
I hear them gossip on the street
Most of what they say is true
Oh, don't you know that I hear them say
"There goes that lazy, no good Snookeroo"


Snookeroo, Snookeroo
Daddy's going on the booze
Mother used to cut my hair
And sister used to make the news
Well, it was two rooms up and two rooms down
We were sentenced by the wrecking crane
Oh, I was born on the eve of Halloween
And Snookeroo, Snookeroo
Snookeroo's my name


Excuse me I'm sorry to bother you
But don't I know you 
There's just something about you
Haven't we met before 
We've been in love forever


When we got on top of the hill
We saw Rome burning
I just let you walk away
I've never forgiven myself

I saw you on the steps in Paris
You were with someone else
Couldn't you see that should have been me 
I just walked on by


Then we met in '42
But we were on different sides
I hid you under my bed
But they took you away


I lost you in a London smog
As you crossed the lane
And I'd never know where you'd gonna be next
But I'd know that you'd surprise me


Come with me, I'll find some rope
I'll tie us together
I've been waiting for you so long
I don't want to lose you again
I don't want to walk into the crowd again
I don't want to walk away again
You remind me so much
Of her when you're walking
Where everything's perfect
And nobody's talking

You're a cushion uncrumpled
You're a bed that's unruffled
The finest bone china
Bone china around

And I believe that the snow queen
Lives somewhere in the hills
She's got the world on a string
Like white wine when it's chilled
Arms are spread like icicles
Upon a frosted cake
The snow queen reigns in warm L.A
Behind the cold black gates

Your talents are tested
They're polished and they're shaped
Your talents are wasted
On men of no taste

But how about proving
That passion means more than
A wardrobe of gowns, TV ratings
J  tive muitos sonhos
Um brilho no olhar
Era s  um jovem
Sem medo de voar
Ent o aos 15 anos
Eu fui ganhar meu p o

Sinto o vento frio cortar meu rosto
Sinto a brisa quente me abater
Mas n o deixarei minha terra
Ficarei aqui at  morrer

Ficarei aqui at  morrer

My bulldog is barking in the backyard
Enough to raise a dead man from his grave
And I can't concentrate on what I'm doing
Disturbance going to crucify my days
And the days they get longer and longer
And the nighttime is a time of little use
For I just get ugly and older
I get juiced on Mateus and just hang loose


And I get bombed for breakfast in the morning
I get bombed for dinnertime and tea
I dress in rags, smell a lot, and have a real good time
I'm a genuine example of a social disease


My landlady lives in a caravan
Well, that is when she isn't in my arms
And it seems I pay the rent in human kindness
But my liquor also helps to grease her palms
And the ladies are all getting wrinkles
And they're falling apart at the seams
Well, I just get high on tequila
And see visions of vineyards in my dreams

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon


Here comes the night
Here come the memories
Lost in your arms
Down in the foreign fields
Not so long ago
Seems like eternity
Those sweet afternoons
Still capture me

Someday out of the blue
In a crowded street
Or a deserted square
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if our love were new
Someday we can start again someday soon


I still believe
I still put faith in us
We had it all
And watched it slip away
Where are we now 
Not where we want to be
Those hot afternoons
Still follow me


Someday out of the blue
Maybe years from now
Or tomorrow night
I'll turn and I'll see you
As if we always knew
Someday we would live again someday soon

When I think of those East End lights, muggy nights
The curtains drawn in the little room downstairs
Prima Donna, lord, you really shoulda been there
Sittin' like a princess perched in her electric chair
And it's one more beer, and I don't hear you anymore
We've all gone crazy lately
My friend's out there, rollin' 'round the basement floor 


And someone saved my life tonight, sugar bear 
You almost had your hooks in me, didn't you, dear 
You nearly had me roped and tied
Altar-bound, hypnotized, sweet freedom whispered in my ear
You're a butterfly, and butterflies are free to fly
Fly away, high away, bye-bye 




I never realized the passin' hours of evening showers
A slip noose hangin' in my darkest dreams
I'm strangled by your haunted social scene
Just a pawn out-played by a dominating queen
It's four o'clock in the morning, damn it! Listen to me good
I'm sleepin' with myself tonight
Saved in time, thank God my music's still alive

And I would have walked head on into the deep end of the river
Clinging to your stocks and bonds
Paying your H.P. demands forever
They're coming in the morning with a truck to take me home
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
Someone saved my life tonight
So save your strength and run the field you play alone

He died when the house was empty
When the maid had gone
He put a pen to paper for one final song
He wrote 
"Oh babe, it's the only way
I know it's wrong but I can't stand
To go on living, to go on living
Living life this way"


"And I don't know what the time is
Or what the next line is
Or how you're gonna take the news
But if I had my life again, ooh ooh
I wouldn't change a thing
I'd let nobody I'd let nobody
Stand inside my shoes"

"Oh, something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers 
And I've drunk myself sober, oh oh
After hours and hours"




"Oh, something's gotten hold of me
This home is not the home it used to be 
I've gathered dust
Like the dying flowers 
And I've drunk myself sober 
After hours and hours 
After hours and hours"There's a saying old says that love is blind
Still we're often told "seek and ye shall find"
So I'm going to seek a certain girl I've had in mind
Looking everywhere, haven't found her yet
She's the big affair I cannot forget
Only girl I ever think of with regret

I'd like to add her initial to my monogram
Tell me where's the shepherd for this lost lamb

There's a somebody I'm longing to see
I hope that she turns out to be
Someone who'll watch over me

I'm a little lamb who's lost in the wood
I know I could always be good
To one who'll watch over me

Although she may not the girl some men think of
As handsome to my heart
She carries the key

Won't you tell her please to put on some speed
Follow my lead, oh how I need
Someone to watch over me
Someone to watch over me
You stare through a tunnel of
Solid wall that should be broken down
And you can't see the field of green
Has been turned into a raging battleground
And you'll live with the consequence
Tell me why don't you understand
You'll destroy all the love that's been created
Be a miser with an empty hand
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world
You don't live in some other world
There's a boat bound for paradise
If you hurry you can ride it back
'Cause once the bait hits the water
It don't take long 'till the sharks attack
Oh but it's all such a simple thing
Change is everything
Let me be the one who brings all this love to you
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Some other world, some other world, that's where you live
Don't you care, stop and think about us and what you feel
I'll be there, don't you cut yourself off from what is real
Don't live in some other world, in some other world
Oh you don't live in some other world, in some other world
Got to stop living in some other world
Let me help you with a change of mind
And it's all such a simple thing
Changing everything
Listen to the one who brings all this love to you
This is our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
Live in our world, not some other world
You don't live in some other world
There was a time I was everything and nothin' all in one
When you found me, I was feelin' like a cloud across the sun


Well, I need to tell ya how you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight, you just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With a smile, you pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty, I'm speechless, and I don't know where to start


And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight


And I can't explain
But it's somethin' about the way you look tonight
Oh, takes my breath away
It's that feelin' I get about you deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight


The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
The way you look tonight
 Way you look tonight
The way you look tonight]
There was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun 

]
And I need to tell you
That you light up every second of the day 
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay


And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight, yeah
Girl, you take my breath away
The way you look tonightThere was a time
I was everything and nothing all in one
When you found me
I was feeling like a cloud across the sun

I need to tell you
How you light up every second of the day
But in the moonlight
You just shine like a beacon on the bay

And I can't explain
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
It's that feeling I get about you, deep inside
And I can't describe
But it's something about the way you look tonight
Takes my breath away
The way you look tonight

With your smile
You pull the deepest secrets from my heart
In all honesty
I'm speechless and I don't know where to startThough Adam was a friend of mine, I did not know him well
He was alone into his distance
He was deep into his well
I could guess what he was laughing at, but I couldn't really tell
Now the story's told that Adam jumped, but I've been thinking that he fell

Together we went traveling, as we received the call
His destination India, and I had none at all
Well, I still remember laughing with our backs against the wall
So free of fear, we never thought that one of us might fall
I sit before my only candle, but it's so little light to find my way
Now this story unfolds before my candle
Which is shorter every hour as it reaches for the day
But I feel just like a candle in the way
I guess I'll get there, but I wouldn't say for sure

When we parted we were laughing still, as our goodbyes were said
And I never heard from him again as each our lives we led
Except for once in someone else's letter that I read
Until I heard the sudden word that a friend of mine was dead

I sit before my only candle, like a pilgrim sits beside the way
Now this journey appears before my candle
As a song that's growing fainter the harder that I play
That I fear before I am a fade away
But I guess I'll get there, though I wouldn't say for sure

Though Adam was a friend of mine, I did not know him long
And when I stood myself beside him, I never though I was as strong
Still it seems he stopped his singing in the middle of his song
Well I'm not the one to say I know, but I'm hoping he was wrong

I'm holding out my only candle, thou
Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything


Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything


Life isn't everything
Isn't everything
Isn't everything


Life, life, life, life
Life, life, life, life, life, life
"I'll catch the tram line in the morning
With your leave", Van Bushell said
He had further heard the cock crow
As he stumbled out the shed
Then blind Joseph came towards him
With a shotgun in his arms
He said, "You'll pay me twenty dollars
Before you leave my farm"
Van Bushell saw a hook
Which replaced Joseph's hand
He said, "Now calm you down, my brother
Let's discuss this man to man"
It's no good you getting angry
We must try to act our age
You're pursuing your convictions
Like some hermit in a cage


You're the son of your father
You try a little bit harder
Do for me as he would do for you
With blood and water, bricks and mortar
He built for you a home
You're the son of your father
So treat me as your own
I'll catch the tramline in the morning
With your leave Van Bushell said

So treat me as your own

Well slowly Joseph well he lowered the rifle
And he emptied out the shells
Van Bushell he came towards him
He shook his arm and wished him well

He said now hey blind man that is fine
But I sure can't waste my time
So move aside and let me go my way
I've got a train to ride

Well Joseph turned around
His grin was now a frown
He said let me just refresh your mind
Your manners boy seem hard to find

JOHN: Neither of us ever thought, back on the first day that we met
We were both so convinced that the dream would never end
Nobody saw the signs man, it's funny how love is blind man
'Cause it can be over just as fast as it begins

So now I be sitting here, I'm alone trying to stuff my fear
Checkin' out one of the pictures there up on the shelf
The story behind my song, is that you never know what you got 'til it's gone

GIRL: What have I gotta do to make you love me 
What have I gotta do to be heard 
What do I do when it's all over 
Sorry seems to be the hardest word

JOHN: How can I forget that day, that I got up and walked away 
I can still see the tears and the years fall from your eyes
And now I'm all alone, I got nothin' else to do but pray
For the dream that I might have you back here in my life

I'm hoping that now you can see, between the real and the fantasy
Reality is rough but it always has a key 
The story behind my words... well
I hope you agree that the truth will set you free

You say today was not so easy
Pressure tends to get the best of you
Well don't let them break your spirit
Keep the faith and you will come on through


And I'll head home for the weekend
You're tired and you know I'll understand
Just be waiting on the front steps baby when I get there
And take a giant step into my hands


And slip into my soul glove
Pull it on we got a tight fit
Never take it off
And baby if the seam's rough
And honey if the skin's soft
You and me we go together
Oh like a soul glove


Look at me don't you believe me
Cheating hangs a noose around your neck
To shave in someone else's mirror
Is one desire I haven't dreamed of yet

Je n'ai jamais cru les hy nes essentielles
Elles sont frustres, ignobles et infectes
Mais elles repr sentent un supr me potentiel
Conjugu    mon puissant intellect


D'accord vos pouvoirs de r flexion
Volent plus bas qu'un derri re de cochon
Mais b te comme vous  tes, Faites attention !
Rebelles et lion font r bellions
Je vois   vos yeux sans expression
Qu'il faut que j' claire vos lanternes
Nous parlons de roi de succession
Vous  tes toutes impliqu es dans l'affaire !

Soyez pr tes pour la chance de votre vie
Car enfin va venir le grand jour !
Nos ennuis sont finis
Nous sortons de la nuit


Et qu'est-ce qu'on doit faire  


M' couter et vous taire

Faites-moi confiance votre r compense
Vous l'aurez quand viendra ce beau jour
Quand la gloire couronnera ma t te
Soyez pr tes !


Ouais soyons pr tes, Nous sommes toutes pr tes ! Pour quoi  


Pour la mort du roi !

Mufasa a toujours impos  trop de contraintes trop de lois en mati re de chasse
Quand je serai roi, je promets de n'imposer qu'une loi, la loi du plus fort
Parce que le ventre d'une hy ne n'est jamais plein
Mufasa est trop puissant impossible de le d fier


Mufasa fait partie du pass 
D'une  poque finie, r volue
Trop d'erreurs, trop d' checs r p t s
Notre heure est enfin venue
Pour nous les lions, les temps ont chang 
Et pour les hy nes bient t aussi
Ma vision est claire et ordonn e
J'ai un projet pour les amis

Soyez pr tes pour le coup le plus g nial
Soyez pr tes pour le plus beau scandale
Je dis compromission
Je dis conspiration
Je crie humiliation
Ces mots feront de moi
Le roi incontest 
Respect , salu 
Le seul dieu vivant qu on acclame
Oui, le roi vous invite   la f te

Oui, le roi vous invite   la f te
Soyez pr tes !
Mufasa a toujours impos  trop de contraintes trop de lois en mati re de chasse
Quand je serai roi, je promets de n'imposer qu'une loi, celle du plus fort
Parce que le ventre d'une hy ne n'est jamais plein
Mufasa est trop puissant impossible de le d fier


Mufasa fait partie du pass 
D'une  poque finie, r volue
Trop d'erreurs, trop d' checs r p t s
Notre heure est enfin venue
Pour nous les lions, les temps ont chang 
Et pour les hy nes bient t aussi
Ma vision est claire et ordonn e
J'ai un projet pour les amis


Soyez pr tes pour le coup le plus g nial
Soyez pr tes pour le plus beau scandale
Je dis compromission
Je dis conspiration
Je crie humiliation !
Ces mots feront de moi
Le roi incontest 
Respect , salu 
Le seul dieu vivant qu on acclame
Oui, le roi vous invite   la f te
Soyez pr tes !

D'accord vos pouvoirs de r flexion
Volent plus bas qu'un derri re de cochon
Mais b te comme vous  tes, Faites attention !
Rebelles et lion font r bellions

Je vois   vos yeux sans expression
Qu'il faut que j' claire vos lanternes
Nous parlons de roi de succession
Vous  tes toutes impliqu es dans l'affaire !

Soyez pr tes pour la chance de votre vie
Car enfin va venir le grand jour !
Nos ennuis sont finis
Nous sortons de la nuit


On fait quoi dans l'histoire  


Rien, croire en ton seigneur

Faites-moi confiance votre r compense
Vous l'aurez quand viendra le grand jour
Quand la gloire couronnera ma t te
Soyez pr tes !
When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's best
When they lay me down to die
Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky

Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky

That's where I'm gonna go when I die

When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best
Prepare yourself, you know it's a must
Gotta have a friend named Jesus
So you know that when you die
It's gonna recommend you to the Spirit in the sky


Goin on up to the Spirit in the sky
That's where you're gonna go when you die

When I die and they lay me to rest
I'm gonna go to the place that's the best

Never been a sinner, I've never sinned
I've got a friend named Jesus
So you know that when I die
It's gonna set me up with the Spirit in the sky

Oh set me up with the spirit in the sky
That's where I'm gonna go when I die
When I die and they lay me to rest
Gonna go to the place that's the best
I'm Gonna go to the place that's the best
I don't want to worry you none but I got the hurt on the run
I just cut out the poison that was in me so long
Watching you tear out my heart only gave me the last laugh
Watching you tear out your hair is gonna be the best part
Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
I've slapped a worried frown on that evil smile
I've been taken down by a spiteful child
I've turned the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child

You'd better be ready to run, now I've got you under the gun
I put my money on vengeance before this race had begun
Breaking the spirit in me only added to your conceit
Playing you at your own game is going to make it complete


Oh I've been shaken down by a spiteful child
Turn the tables round and it drives you wild
Oh you spiteful child




Spiteful
Night life, hot spotlight
I gotta make them dance tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I really want to shine tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I gotta steal a heart tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I'll show them how to dance tonight


I know that the competition's heavy
I know that these guys are cool
But I'll show this kid is more than ready
I sure got something to prove


Right now I'm just another guy
I don't mean nothing to them
But when they see me dance
When they see me dance


Night life, hot spotlight
I gotta make them dance tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I really want to shine tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I gotta steal a heart tonight
Night life, hot spotlight
I'll show them how to dance tonight
Ecco che il tempo cambia gi 
Comincia qui un nuovo ciclo ormai
E sento che la mia stagione   qui
Fa freddo, ma c'  il fuoco accanto a te

Di fuori no, un suono non c'  pi 
Le stagioni stan dormendo intorno a noi
Scorre acqua nuova dentro agli occhi tuoi
Com   strano essere amanti io e te
Eravamo solo amici io e te
E cos  la vita cambia in me
Io amo te, la mia parola   s 
Impazzir  nel buio la citt 
Che chiaro c' , che pace insieme a te

Ma come mai il tempo fugge gi 
Le stagioni ora sono realt 
  tornato il vento e l'amore va

Giving all your love to just one man
Oh, you have bad times, and you have good times
Doing things that you don't understand

Hey, but if you love him, you'll forgive him
Even though he's hard to understand
And if you love him, be proud of him
'Cause after all, he's just a man

Stand by your man
Give him two arms to cling to
And someone warm to come to
When nights are cold and lonely

Stand by your man
And show the world you love him
Keep giving all the love you canStanding room only
Here in my heart, babe
You can come in, child
But you can't sit down
 don't need a ticket
It's an open party
So fold up your wings, little darling of mine
And stick around
Here in this crowded world
Don't wanna build no more walls, now
If you keep an open heart
There should be room for all
And now it's standing room only
Whenever you're near me
There's always a part of me, yeah
You can call your own
So while you're away, child
Won't you try to see clearly
You got so much love I can win your heart
Let's go run along



Here in this crowded world
Don't wanna build no more walls, now
If you keep an open heart
There'll be room for all
But now it's standing room only
And you can't sit down








Fades
Dear Slim, I wrote you, but you still ain't callin'
I left my cell, my pager and my home phone at the bottom
I sent two letters back in autumn, you must not've got 'em
There probably was a problem at the post office or somethin'
Sometimes I scribble addresses too sloppy when I jot 'em
But anyways, F it, what's been up, man  How's your daughter 
My girlfriend's pregnant too, I'm 'bout to be a father
If I have a daughter, guess what I'ma call her 
I'ma name her Bonnie
I read about your Uncle Ronnie too, I'm sorry
I had a friend kill himself over some - who didn't want him
I know you probably hear this every day, but I'm your biggest fan
I even got the underground stuff that you did with Skam
I got a room full of your posters and your pictures, man
I like the shit you did with Rawkus too, that - was phat
Anyways, I hope you get this, man, hit me back
Just to chat, truly yours, your biggest fan, this is Stan

My tea's gone cold
I'm wondering why I got out of bed at all
The morning rain clouds up my window
And I can't see at all
And even if I could it'd all be gray
But your picture on my wall
It reminds me that it's not so bad, it's not so bad


Dear Slim, you still ain't called or wrote, I hope you have a chance
I ain't mad, I just think it's fucked up you don't answer fans
If you didn't want to talk to me outside your concert, you didn't have to
But you coulda signed an autograph for Matthew
That's my little brother, man, he's only six years old
We waited in the blisterin' cold
For you, for four hours, and you just said no
That's pretty crummy man, you're like his favorite idol
He wants to be just like you, man, he likes you more than I do
I ain't that mad, though I just don't like bein' lied to
Remember when we met in Denver 
You said if I'd write you, you would write back
See, I'm just like you in a way: I never knew my father neither
He used to always cheat on my mom and beat her
I can relate to what you're sayin' in your songs
So when I have a crummy day, I drift away and put 'em on
 Cause I don't really got shit else
So that shit helps when I'm depressed
I even got a tattoo with your name across the chest
Sometimes I even cut myself to see how much it bleeds
It's like adrenaline, the pain is such a sucker rush for me
See, everything you say is real, and I respect you  cause you tell it
My girlfriend's jealous 'cause I talk about you 24/7
But she don't know you like I know you, Slim, no one does
She don't know what it was like for people like us growin' up
You gotta call me, man, I'll be the biggest fan you'll ever lose
Sincerely yours, Stan P.S. We should be together too

Mufasa legt jullie te veel beperkingen op als het om de jacht gaat
Met mij als koning zijn jullie vrij om te nemen wat jullie willen
Want een hyenamaag is nooit vol
Mufasa is veel te machtig om te verslaan


Mufasa is over zijn top heen
Zijn regime is verouderd, verzwakt
De tijd vraagt in plaats van zo'n snob een
Strateeg met visie en tact
Het leeuwenrijk staat op een keerpunt
Een kans voor hyena s als groep
Want ik heb een plan met als speerpunt
Geen honger meer voor jullie troep

Sta paraat voor een greep naar de macht en
Doe mee aan mijn duivelse plan
Na jarenlang wachten, met wraak in gedachten
Is dit het moment, ja, dat ik word erkend, ja
Als koning aller dieren, een naam die zal sieren
Zal ik laten zien wat ik kan
Wij zijn samen tot alles in staat
Sta paraat




Sta paraat, sta paraat

Sta paraat


Sta paraat

Wij zijn samen tot alles in staat
Sta paraat
Mufasa heeft jullie altijd beperkingen opgelegd, wat de jacht betreft
Met mij als koning zijn jullie vrij om te nemen wat jullie willen
Want een hyenamaag is nooit gevuld
Mufasa is te machtig om te verslaan


Mufasa, zijn macht is verdwenen
Zijn regime verouderd, verzwakt
Het is nu hoog tijd voor diegene
Met een plan en visie en tact
Het leeuwenrijk staat op een keerpunt
Een kans voor hyena's als groep
En ik h b een plan met als speerpunt
Geen honger meer voor jullie tro p

Steal away child into your dreams
Where nothing is ever the way that it seems
I gave you your life, you gave me your trust
I've no wish to hurt you but hurt you i must
Steal away child, turn down your light
Steal away into the night

Steal away child to the land of the lies
Where love lasts forever and hope never dies
Sit safe for a place peaceful and calm
Where no one and nothing can harm you
Steal away child, you'll be alright
Steal away into the night
Once more goodnight, one last goodbye
Trying hard not to show how i'm making what it's taking not to cry

Steal away child, sleeping so still
Our love is too precious for distance to kill
But when you awake, morning has come
I won't be the one you turn to
I'll do what i must before it gets light
I'll steal away into the night

Steal away child
Steal away into the nightWelcome to my Christmas song

One two, one two three


Say what you will but I'm a stinker
I come crawling up out of my hole
Dirt in my toes, dirt up my nose
I'm a perfect curse to pest control


Seeds and weeds and muddy meals
Crawlin' around the earth
Down in the ground where the sun don't pound
Oh, I hibernate in English turf

Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burnin' vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave, honey
Tell me what your hound dogs think


Set in my styles with a beady eye
I got connections with the underground
Call me a common rodent boy
Sitting here safe and sound


Better believe it, I'm a stinker
Burnin' vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave, honey
Tell me what your hound dogs think




Oh, better believe I'm a stinker
Burnin' vermin stink
Watch me get as high as a heat wave, honey
Tell me what your hound dogs think

We broke the rules together
I'm guilty for the crime
You call me up at 3 AM
To kill me one more time
We re dancing in slow motion
The house is set on fire
We hurt the ones we love the most
Tempted by desire


Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

Our love was like a stolen car
Racing down the freeway
Drinking for a new day
Wasted in an old dive bar
Nobody knew our names
Damn, thos  were the good days
Oh, w  knew that it wouldn't last
But we did it to remember
Our love was like a stolen car
Pulled over on the freeway
'Cause it was never ours


The night knows every secret
The morning never tells
I m not ready to leave yet
But you need somebody else
You kiss me on the forehead
As distance fills the room
Like holding on to water
You're always gone too soon


Smoke rings, tattoos, warning signs
Sink your teeth in, babe, be mine

Help me information
Get emotion on the line
This war that's raging in my heart's
Getting harder all the time
Our painted smiles are cracking
Our worried friends just frown
We got a runaway train on an empty track
That's trying to run us down


And I'm a stone's throw from hurting
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurting
And I know it's never gonna get no better

Crippled conversation hangs inside this house
Our voices just get ugly
When our love gets all talked out
Your goodnight kiss ain't hungry
Our touches don't connect
We're just a couple of kids with a broken toy
That our idle fingers wrecked


And I'm a stone's throw from hurting
Everything we put together
Knee deep in learning about burning this bridge forever
I'm a stone's throw, a stone's throw
A stone's throw from hurting
And I know it's never gonna get no better


Some things get broken
When stones get thrown
Some things get better
When you leave what you love
And you let what you love alone


Time has gone by
The calendar leaves
I might try phoning
If I could think of the words to try

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
She never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fall

She left in the morning
Was her way
And on returning
I find I have nothing to say

What is there to remember
The winter was December
Just one more year left behind

She never looked around to see me
Oh, she never looked around at all
All I saw was her shadows on the wall
She never looked around to see me
No, she never looked around at all
All I heard was the snow that had to fallTwo people caught on a string
A high-wire act above the center ring
While the audience is wondering
If we'll make it back

Two people up on a wire
Overhead and under fire
While the audience enquire
If it's just a knack

Strangers, after all, we find we're strangers
After all this time
We've made the long and the lonely climb
And now we've reached the part
Where we find we're strangers
We were strangers from the start
Two people caught in the tide
On the edge of love and pride
And both afraid to approach the side
And fall again

Two people playing the part
But which is life and which is art
And isn't it a little late
Street guys walking, dancing
Sidewalk music, hot thing
They got their boxes tuned into their favorite show
As they truck on down the road
Is that the radio  Yes, that's the radio
Let it go, let it go, let it go


Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie, street boogie
Street boogie, street boogie

Traffic, skater rolling
Sharing music, sure thing
He got his shoulder holster turned way up loud
As he wheels his way around
Is that the radio  Yes, that's the radio
Catch the sound, catch the sound, catch the sound


Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie, street boogie
Street boogie, street boogie


Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie
Boogie, street boogie


Street boogie got a hold on me
Street boogie going to set me free
Street boogie keep a hold on me
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright with me
Street boogie, it's the city beat
Street boogie on the boogie street
Street boogie, yeah and that's for me
Street boogie, street boogie
Street boogie, street boogie

They must've had the whole thing planned
There must have been a hundred
If we make a stand
I think we'll be outnumbered
If I'd had the chance
Then I could understand
Why I'm a juvenile delinquent
In an east end gang


And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive

It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around


I've been bottled and been brained
Squealers can't be trusted
Ooh, if we fight tonight
You can bet we'll all be busted
I'd like to break away
From the rut I'm in
But beggars can't be choosers
Yeah, and I was born to sin


And if you think you've seen gasoline
Burning in my eyes
Don't be alarmed, and tell yourself
It's good to be, it's good to be alive


It's just another street kid on your tail
Running on the wrong side of the rails
With my boot lace tie and my hand-me-downs
You know I run the toughest bunch this side of town
Those street kids making news just being around

"But the thing I want more than anything in the whole world is a new bike. Love, Chase."
Ho ho ho! What a good boy! Let's give him that bike and a helmet!
Good thinking, Santa!
Oh, and here's one from Emily. "Dear Santa, this year I want a Disney princess mirror!"
That's exactly what she'll get, huh  Who's next  Rupert 
Um --
Rupert, what is it 
It's just, heh, mine's a little weird
I'm sure it's not that weird. Just read it!
Um, okay. But it starts normal enough. Dear Santa:

Dear Santa, I can't believe the year is almost over
It's getting colder, I'm a year older, but I'm still your soldier
You're my hero because you always bring me the assist
So once again we're back to zero, here we go, my Christmas list
I won't be greedy or needy or ask you for too much
Just want one thing and hope you still got that magic touch
'Cause gettin' this present is the only thing keeping me alive
Dear Santa Claus, please bring me a PS5
I tried to buy one at Wal-Mart, ran around the shopping mall like Paul Blart
Tried to find one on sale, but the thing is that they're all out
Yo, I even went to a GameStop, but then I was like " Oh, Wait, stop!
"Santa Claus can make one, the man got his own workshop."
I know you prob'ly hear this every day, but you got a cool hat
I love that movie you did with Will Ferrell, man, Elf was phat
Anyways, I love the things you do
Don't forget, bring my gift, truly yours, I believe in you
This is Stu


La la la la la la la
La la la la la


Dear Santa, I noticed you never wrote me a letter back
That's fine, dawg, except not really, I think that's kinda wack
If you can't help your biggest fan, then you should just retire
Or next time you slide down my chimney, I'll set your ass on fire
Just playin', I still love you, my girl thinks that I'm obsessed
I even got a tattoo of your name across my chest
Just bring that PS5, bro, if it's the only thing you do
Sincerely yours, Stu P.S. We should live together, too
Dido

Stu is waiting for his surprise
To open up a PS5
He just really wants to play
Assassin's Creed on Christmas Day
But he can't buy it himself because he lost his job
'Cause he was stealing from his boss
I'd be worried 'cause he's a scary guy
A scary guy

Special delivery!
La la la la la la la
La la la la la


Dear Mr. Holly-Jolly-Two-Faced-Son-of-a-Bitch
I hope you crash your sleigh and wind up face-down in a ditch
I guess even the great Saint Nick can't track down a PS5
Hey Santa, I drank a fifth of eggnog, dare me to drive 
You ruined Christmas! I wish I never told you what was on my wishlist!
Screw you, your elves, your stupid beard, and your bitch tits!
So this'll be my last letter, I know you'll miss me when I'm gone
Sincerely yours, Stu!
Ladies and gentlemen, Sir Elton John

This year, Christmas will be bad
'Cause Santa sucks and Stu is sad
Already asked you very nicely
And now he's really pissed off
I'm just telling you
'Cause I like you a lot
I'm a big fan of Santa Claus
And I also want a PS5
A PS5



Santa, this is serious!


Don't panic, don't panic!


I'm freaking out! Aaaah!


All right, all right, all right! I think it's time I write a letter back to Stu
"Dear Stu, I think you got the wrong address, bro. I'm not Santa Claus. Bye-bye!"
Damn!

What's this  "To Shady, from Santa." That's crazy! A PS5  I didn't even ask for this. I guess Shady must've been a good boy this year. Sorry, Stu. You f***** upYou're a stranger to me
Then you give me your life
I toss it to one side
Still you're sweeter to me
When we lie on the shore
It's warm where you are
But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I ask for more
Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
Behind me
There ain't no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I can kill
When I turn around you're there
Should I ask for more
I feel like sugar on the floor
I feel like sugar on the floorYou're a stranger to me
Then you give me your life
I toss it to one side
Still you're sweeter to me
When we lie on the shore

It's warm where you are
But my lips just don't burn
I feel so insecure
When you try to be kind
Could I ask for more

Looking at you now I know you only want to find me
Still I need a reason to leave the past behind me
Behind me
There ain't no easy way
To learn how to fly
I hope that I can kill
When I turn around you're there
Should I ask for more
I feel like sugar on the floor
I feel like sugar on the floorLooking back in anger
On this dirty little town
It stained your dress carved up my face
Put a wedge between our state of grace

Somethings so young and pretty
Should never be released
We place our bets we take our pick
They wind up in the belly of the beast

And when you can't get what you want
You take anything you can
So I wear this suit of wolves at night
I slip it on how come it feels so right

I get a hungry man
When I can't get what I want
I take anything I can
I wear a suit of wolves

Just across from Friday
The weekend circus rolls
I cross my heart turn on the charm
I say my prayers between two hungry arms

There's a string of dangerous flowers
All around my bed
There's some want rings and some just want
And those who'd like to see me dead
For every man in power there's two, that you don t see
Well, did you know that 
And with each passing hour, there's less that we can be
Well, did you know that 
So ask yourself this question: who of us is free 
Mhm... and do we dare to show them we see 
Oh, they won't like it, no


Sunshine, send them away
Sunshine, don t let then stay
Oh sunshine, help us, I pray
They've got control all the way
And it's unhealthy


Although we never see them, it's they who pull the strings
Well, did you know that 
And those you choose as your l aders
Are just pawns to thes  dark kings
Well, did you know that 
So ask yourself this question: had you noticed all these things 
Oh... and he who knows is brave, who still sings
For his freedom, yeah
You came walking by where I was sitting pretty
Said, "Hey, babe, do you want to dance with me "
And I noticed that you acted kind of funky
As if somehow you were trying to be

Supercool, no one's fool, just a rolling stone
Acting out your party piece
In Valentino tones

Smoking untipped cigarettes
And calling me a doll
Sometimes I really wonder
If you're happening at all
Oh, supercool, I gotta lose you
And your hip asides
All this fair out, yeah, yeah, right on, baby
Teenage talking jive

Supercool, go back to school
Let's keep the whole thing clean
As you would say in your sweet way
You're really not my scene

You cocked your brand-new felt hat to one side
Like Bogart used to do on the screen
You've got to realize that I'm a big girl
Older enough to know you're early in your teens
I got frostbitten in the winter
Ice skating on the river
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
She'd make your darn toes curl just to see her, yeah


I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side


Well, she sure knows how to use me
Pretty little black-eyed Susie
Playing hooky with my heart all the time
Living with her funky family
In a derelict old alley
Down by the river where we share a little loving in the moonshine


I'm an old hayseed harp player
I'm the hit of the county fair
With my pretty little black-eyed girl
Living proof as she swirls, she's a dancer, yeah


I got a fringe front on my buggy
I got a frisky little colt in a hurry
And a pretty little black-eyed Susie by by by my side
NoneNone
No ceiling on hard living
Peace keepers keep on breathing
Can't deny eye for eye
It's open season
Dictate to my reason
She devils ruling Britain
Hey girl stick it in your purse
Call it treason
Band aids on dead doorways
No heroes in the Bat Cave
Don't give me Tears For Fears
Give me tears of rage
Fires burn with black smoke
Oil slicks put us on the ropes
Man it's hard to handle
When the bank's broke


Don't kow-tow, don't bow down
Loosen up, get the lead out
Backs up let them shout
Backs up sweat it out
When your back's up, sweat it out
Backs up, sweat it out
See the day she has found another soul
New life begins as a story to be told
Brighter than ever was before
How could anything be so sure
That to see a new life begin

Life unfolds as the circle starts to turn
Round and around and the flame begins to burn
Brighter than ever was before
How could anything be so sure
How could anyone ask for more
Than to see a new life begin
Yours and mine
Sweet creation
The miracle of birth
Born to the confusion of this earth

All my life I have waited for this time
Here in my arms lies the future yours and mine
Brighter than ever was before
How could anything be so sure
How could anyone ask for more
Than to see a new life begin

Yours and mine
Sweet creation
Another child confused
Take the air in
All is lost
All the wonderEverybody loves to love
The local girl made good
Surely I'd find peace of mind
If anybody could

Still at times I find myself
Wishing they were right
If everybody loves me
Where are they tonight 

Everybody loves to love
The sweetheart on parade
Out there on the stage tonight
The girl who's got it made
But after the applause is gone
I sometimes wish I knew
Why everybody loves me
And I love only you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give 
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live 
All I need is someone I can share it with

But how they love to love
The golden girl next door
Up there with her name in lights
Now who could ask for more 

Still I can't help wondering
Why it should be true
That everybody loves me
Everyone but you

Haven't I got all the things success alone can give 
Wouldn't everybody love to lead the life I live 
All I need is someone I can share it with

Everybody loves me, everyone but youTalk of making love
Take your time
To bluff your way to stay
Let me use your eyes
Please don't amuse with words that cut me down to size
With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Do I need to say
That I'm wiser with surprise for borrowing your eyes
Morning sets the scene
The more you stay the more you go away from me it seems

With your lovely mind
Never taking time
To treat a man so kind

You remain to me a vision of sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honesty
Sweet honestyI'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
I'm back on dry land once again
Opportunity awaits me like a rat in the drain
We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

If the boys all behave themselves here
Well there's pretty young ladies and beer in the rear
You won't need a gutter to sleep in tonight
Oh the prices I charge here will see you alright

So she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

Oh sweet painted lady
Seems it's always been the same
Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game

Forget us we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said
I'm back on dry land once again

We're all hunting honey with money to burn
Just a short time to show you the tricks that we've learned

Getting paid for being laid
Guess that's the name of the game, oh


Forget us, we'll have gone very soon
Just forget we ever slept in your rooms
And we'll leave the smell of the sea in your beds
Where love's just a job and nothing is said


So as she lays down beside me again
My sweet painted lady, the one with no name
Many have used her and many still do
There's a place in the world for a woman like you

On a good day I can see forever
I can take my time and get to know who you are
It s a mystery, it s never in the stars
It s in your blood, tears and heart
And there must be a good reason these things take time
Love is only a season in the year of your mind and I d like to think that I m honest
It s better for your health, but well, sometimes I fool myself that


The symmetry of two hearts is never easy
I never know where to start but I really try
Even if we re two parts of one puzzle I still, I still wish we were one

And in the mornings I tend to find myself over thinking
Worried that someone else might not remember the little words I say
Oh what a waste of time and a waste of space
Cos one mind can only hold on to so much:
A kiss 
A moment 
Or a touch 
And there must be a good reason that some people forget. Instead  I just remind myself that


The symmetry of two hearts is never easy
I never know where to start but I really try
Even if we re two parts of one puzzle I still, I still wish we were one

Ohhhhhh

One kiss and the ice might melt, remember
One word and the world might fall at your feet
Cos one dream can be shared by more than one mind, but they re just so hard to find


The symmetry of two hearts is never easy
I never know where to start but I really try
Even if we re two parts of one puzzle I still, I still wish we were oneNone
If you want my loving take me back
If you miss my touch little girl take me back
When the dreams you lean on are beginning to crack
Open up your heart little girl and take me back
If you want my loving then take me back
If you're on your own little girl take me back
When the nights grow longer turning blacker than black
Open up your heart little girl and take me back


Playing a part you're well prepared for, there you stand
With all I ever cared for in your hand
I'm waiting all the time
For some kind of sign from you
And I'll go on and on this way
Waiting for the day
When I will hear you say
You'll take me back


If you want my loving well take me back
If you're feeling down little girl
Then you'll take me back
When you look around you for the love that you lack
Open up your heart little girl
You got my heart little girl
Make a start little girl
And say you'll take me back
Take me backTake me down to the water
Take me back to the source
Call the meeting to order
And let it run its course

Take me back to my childhood
When I was so alone
Let me feel like a child would
Looking out across the great unknown

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
Forget the tied up time and let my spirit free

Take away the illusion
Of the man, of the king
Help me lose the confusion
So I can breathe again

Take me down to the ocean
Take me down to the sea
Set the feeling in motion
So you can just be you and I can just be meNoneIf you feel that it's real I'm on trial

Don't you worry where I'm going
I'll just go without you knowing
I won't come back to you again
I'll leave right now and catch the train

Don't you wait for me anymore
I loved you then and then I was sure
Our love was something at the start
You killed the sun and you broke my heart

Why oh why did you do it
I thought I'd never get through it
While you were telling me lies
You were taking the sun
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
Taking the sun from my eyes
So just listen to me while I say
Forget all the love of those days
They're only empty and they're goneNone
Why hello, say, can I buy you another glass of beer 
Well, thanks a lot, that's kind of you, it's nice to know you care
These days there's so much going on
No one seems to wanna know
I may be just an old soldier to some
But I know how it feels to grow old


Yeah, that's right, you can see me here most every night
You'll always see me staring at the walls and at the lights
Funny, I remember, oh, it's years ago, I'd say
I'd stand at that bar with my friends who've passed away
And drink three times the beer that I can drink today
Yes, I know how it feels to grow old


I know what they're saying, son
There goes old man Joe again
Well, I may be mad at that I've seen enough
To make a man go out his brains
Well, do they know what it's like to have a graveyard as a friend
'Cause that's where they are, boy, all of them
Don't seem likely I'll get friends like that again, yeah


Well, it's time I moved off
But it's been great just listening to you
And I might even see ya next time I'm passing through
You're right, there's so much going on
No one seems to want to know
So keep well, keep well old friend
And have another drink on me
Just ignore all the others
You got your memories
You got your memoriesIt feels like I'm flying
When I see your face
I'm charged with a power
Of amazing grace
I flip the switch signal
On the permanent dream
Like the palm of my hand
On a tambourine

Dumb rocks filling up
My poor head
Did you just say
What I thought you said
First cat back here gets the cream
And bounce a little river
Of my tambourine

Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine


A curveball coming
That I didn't see
A flash flood washing
Out a dried up creek
A went in muddy
But I came out clean
Like a Baptist banging
On a tambourine


Smack in the middle
Toss it in the air
I don't care
You can play me everywhere
Roll and rattle
When I'm out of steam
You got my head ringing like a tambourine
The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the Tartan Coloured Lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the Tartan Coloured Lady she is mine

People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my doesn't fit her anymore
And the Tartan Coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place an hour or so before
And the Tartan Coloured Lady lost her
So if your crystal window isn't broken
And they've taken all the dust bins from your door
Take yourself the Tartan Coloured Lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more

So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the Tartan Coloured Lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home till fourGet the fuck outside

This is the news
One, two, three, four

The grass in Ashfield Park is dying
Where everybody dreams of deeds of crime
And the tartan coloured lady walks
Behind the water colours of my mind
And the tartan coloured lady she's mine
People speak of willow trees in autumn
And my clove-key doesn't fit her anymore
And the tartan coloured Lady that I wanted
Talked of this place, an hour or so before
And the tartan coloured lady lost her dog

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And th y've taken all the dustbins from your door
Tak  yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more

So I guess I'll read the comic books you've left me
And play marbles on the floor
And if the tartan coloured lady calls me
Just tell her I won't be home 'til four
Oh just tell her, I won't be home no more

So if your crystal window isn't broken
And they've taken all the dustbins from your door
Take yourself the tartan coloured lady
And smell the grass in Ashfield Park once more
See the trees in Ashfield Park once more
I was sitting in the classroom
Trying to look intelligent
In case the teacher looked at me
She was long and she was lean
She's a middle-aged dream
And that lady means the whole world to me


It's a natural achievement
Conquering my homework
With her image pounding in my brain
She's an inspiration
For my graduation
And she helps to keep the classroom sane

Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you


I have to write a letter, ooh
Tell about my feelings
Just to let her know the scene
Focus my attention
On some further education
In connection with the birdies and the bees


Oh, so I'm sitting in the classroom, woo!
I'm looking like a zombie
I'm waiting for the bell to ring
I've got John Wayne stances
I've got Errol Flynn advances
And it doesn't mean a doggoned thing


Oh, teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
Oh teacher, I need you like a little child
You got something in you to drive a schoolboy wild
You give me education in the lovesick blues
Help me get straight, come out and say
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I, teacher, I need you
Whenever I hear good-byes
Reminds me baby of you
I break down and cry
Next time I'll be true, yeah
*Feels as if we lost romance*
Reminds me baby of you
*I took a crazy chance*
The next time I'll be true, I'll be true, I'll be true


Footsteps on the dance-floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune, every tune

And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

*When I'm dancing round*
Remind me baby of you
I really let you down
Next time I'll be true, I'll be true


Footsteps on the dance-floor
Remind me baby of you
Teardrops in my eyes
Next time I'll be true, yeah
Whispers in the back room
She cries on every tune, every tune


And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you
And the music don't feel like it did when I felt it with you
Nothing that I do or feel ever feels like I felt it with you

Hurting deep inside, she cries on every tune
I break down and cry, she cries on every tune, every tune, every tune
Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Will it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong, and carry on
Cause I know I don t belong
Here in heaven

Would you hold my hand
If I saw you in heaven
Would you help me stand
If I saw you in heaven
I ll find my way, through night and day
Cause I know I just can t stay
Here in heaven
Time can bring you down
Time can bend your knee
Time can break your heart
Have you begging please
Begging please



Beyond the door
There s peace I m sure
And I know there ll be no more
Tears in heaven

Would you know my name
If I saw you in heaven
Would it be the same
If I saw you in heaven
I must be strong, and carry on
Cause I know I don t belong
Here in heaven

Cause I know I don t belong
Here in heaven
Hello 
Hello 


Hello, I said hello
Is this the only place you felt to go 
Am I the only man you ever had 
Or am I just the last surviving friend 
Hello, baby, hello
Open up your heart and let your feelings flow
You're not unlucky knowing me
Keeping the speed real slow


Hello 
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes and we will see
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes and we will see
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes and we will see
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes and we will see
Do you know what I mean 
Have your eyes and we will see
I spy headlines, newsprint tells lies
Tell me what the papers say
Save lives don't drive, everybody's got to die someday
At least that's what the papers say


Coal mines closed down
Nobody's working underground today
More jails, peace for sale
Japanese still killing whales
Teen dreams
On two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say



Dope and pills, guns kill
Death just buys cheap thrills
Coal mines, closed down
Nobody's working underground today
Teen dreams, on two inch screens
Lipstick boys all look like queens
Least that's what the papers say
There's a dusty old gutter he's lying in now
Mmm, He's blind and he's old
And there's a bottle that rolls down the road
Me, I'm young and I'm so wild
And I still feel the need
Of your apron strings once in a while
For there's taxi cabs a-hooting
But I can't be foot-loose forever
My suitcase it's a cheap one
My darling, she's a dear one
My head's feeling light as a feather


Take my ears and tell me when the whistle blows
Wake me up and tell me when the whistle blows
Long lost and lonely boy
You're just a black sheep going home
I want to feel your wheels of steel
Underneath my itching heels
Take my money
Tell me when the whistle blows


Part of me asked the young man for the time
With a cool vacant stare
Of undue concern, he said nine
It's not so bad but I really do love the land
And rather all this than those diamante lovers
In Hyde Park holding hands
Blowing heat through my fingers
Trying to kill off this cold
Will the street kids remember 
Can I still shoot a fast cue 
Has this country kid still got his soul 

I heard from a friend you'd been messing around
With a cute little thing I'd been dating uptown
Well I don't know if I like that idea much
Well you'd better stay clear I might start acting rough
You out of town guys sure think you're real keen
Think all of us boys here are homespun and green
But that's wrong my friend so get this through your head
We're tough and we're Texan with necks good and red


So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die

How dare you sit there and drink all our beer
Oh it's made for us workers who sweat spit and swear
The minds of our daughters are poisoned by you
With your communistic politics and them negro blues
Well I'm gonna quit talking and take action now
Run all of you fairies clean out of this town
Oh I'm dog tired of watching you mess up our lives
Spending the summertime naturally high


So it's Ki yi yippie yi yi
You long hairs are sure gonna die
Our American home was clean till you came
And kids still respected the president's name
And the eagle still flew in the sky
Hearts filled with national pride
Then you came along with your drug-crazy songs
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Goddammit you're all gonna die
Oh Lord Goddammit you're all gonna die
Listen now
Oh, pity me
I'm so alone and so blue
My friends have all gone away
Their friendliness too


It was I on my own
With no need to belong
And I wanted to die
That s when you came along


And thank you for all of your lovin'
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for bein' here


What a difference it made
My life has started again
And if you go away
It just won t be the same


It's hard to say what I feel
When I'm by your side
You're there when I'm worried
All my troubles, in you I confide

Oh, pity me
I'm so alone and so blue
My friends have all gone away
Their friendliness too


It was I on my own
With no need to belong
And I wanted to die
That's when you came along


And thank you for all of your loving
Thank you for all of your tears
Thank you for all of your kindness
Thank you for being here


What a difference it made
My life has started again
And if you go away
It just won't be the same


It's hard to say what I feel
When I'm by your side
You're there when I'm worried
All my troubles, in you I confide
None
Now the world has turned away
My life gets colder every day
You don't know how it is
I lost all my will to live
You've taken the love I have to give
You don't know how it is


Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
T ll me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is


Thank you Mama, you eas  to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again

Thank you Mama, you ease to please again
You know Mama, you take the pain away
Oh it's sad but not so bad
Make me lose the blues I had
Thank you Mama, you ease to please again


Well Sunday comes along with the wind
Every Sunday was spent with him
You don't know how it is
We would watch the flames burn higher
Tell me Mama started to cry
You don't know how it is
There's more to life than panic
And being some other guy's snack
Eugh!
I may be delicious, organic
But this little entree's fightin' back!

I'm gonna put diggin' tunnels behind me
And live at a new altitude
I'm gonna reach for the stars to remind me
That meerkats are not merely food!


For once I'll be

Looking out for me!




Yeah!
I'll tell you what I want
This 'kat is moving on
Where he's a bonlibonte
Who's missing out on bone
I'd be a big cheese
Far from the desert scene
A little cooling breeze
A little patch of green
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you

And if I should ever go away
Well then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Keep smiling, keep shining
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends are for
Well you came in loving me
And now there's so much more I see
And so by the way I thank you

Oh and then for the times when we're apart
Well then close your eyes and know
The words are coming from my heart
And then if you can rememberBILL
And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe, I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well, then close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember

Let s all swear that if It isn t dead, It ever comes back, we will too! AHHHH
Keep smiling

BEV, BILL, BEN, RICHIE, EDDIE, MIKE, STAN
Keep shining

BILL
Knowing you can always count on me, for sure

BEV, BILL, BEN, RICHIE, EDDIE, MIKE, STAN
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forever more
That's what friends ar  for

BILL
Come on, Mike

RICHIE
No

EDDIE
Don t do it, Mike

STAN
I don t want to see that

And I never thought I'd feel this way
And as far as I'm concerned
I'm glad I got the chance to say
That I do believe I love you
And if I should ever go away
Well then, close your eyes and try
To feel the way we do today
And then if you can remember


Keep smilin', keep shinin'
Knowin' you can always count on me for sure
That's what friends are for
For good times and bad times
I'll be on your side forevermore
That's what friends are for


Well, you came and opened me
And now there's so much more I see
And so, by the way, I thank you
Oh, and then, for the times when we're apart
Well then, close your eyes and know
These words are comin' from my heart
And then if you can remember, oh
Don't wish it away
Don't look at it like it's forever
Between you and me I could honestly say
That things can only get better
And while I'm away
Dust out the demons inside
And it won't be long before you and me run
To the place in our hearts where we hide
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Just stare into space
Picture my face in your hands
Live for each second without hesitation
And never forget I'm your man
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Wait on me girl
Cry in the night if it helps
But more than ever I simply love you
More than I love life itself
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Time on my hands could be time spent with you
Laughing like children, living like lovers
Rolling like thunder under the covers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Laughing like children, living like lovers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
Laughing like children, living like lovers
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
And I guess that's why they call it the blues
"Say that boy's a wonderment"
"No! The kid's a freak"
But that kid he don't care none
His black hands resting on the keys
Hopping like a big old frog
And hissing like a train
Entertaining royalty
All points east, west and in-between
General he's a fine old man
Treat him like his own
"Boy wouldn't know from money"
Just throw old Blind Tom a bone
From the times of King Cotton
May we present to you
All you Jim Crow monkeys
From Harlan County down to Tuscaloo
Play me anything you like
I'll play it back to you
Be careful what you call me though
Some things cut clear on through
I may be an idiot
I may be a savant
I didn't choose this life for me
But it's something that I want
Cocks that old big head aside
Grunts a word or two
Keeps them guessing every night
Is he really going to make it through
Faint hearts with their fans out
Starched collars and cigars
He weren't no use for slaving
"I wouldn't want him in my yard"
Some punk with a shotgun killed young Danny Bailey
In cold blood, in the lobby of a downtown motel
Killed him in anger, a force he couldn't handle
Helped pull the trigger that cut short his life
And there's not many knew him the way that we did
Sure enough he was a wild one, but then aren't most hungry kids 


Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead, oh
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in

We're running short of heroes back up here in the hills
Without Danny Bailey, we're gonna have to break up our stills
So mark his grave well 'cause Kentucky loved him
Born and raised a proper, I guess life just bugged him
And he found faith in danger, a lifestyle he lived by
A running gun youngster in a sad restless age


Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
Dillinger's dead
I guess the cops won again
Now it's all over, Danny Bailey
And the harvest is in
I hear you singing, "I Shall Be Released"
Like a chainsaw running through a masterpiece
But that's all right, that's ok
Grab the bottle and slide my way
You dreamed of a devil down below
Sprinkled cayenne pepper in your sugar bowl
But he's a fool and he's a thief
Got silly little horns and pointed teeth


Roll back the covers and raise the shades
We don't want to miss out on the best part of the day
You're my best friend you shared my crazy ways
Now we don't want to miss out on the best part of the day


There's a canyon where an echo hangs
Like the ancient bells of Notre Dame
It's beyond the hills out of sight
Thought I heard 'em ringing all last night
Hear the mating call of the morning dove
Like Romeo angels in the roof above
Rains will come sweet and clean
Let the tears of God keep the mountains green

On and on
The story of our lives goes on and on
The path of time
The sunsets up ahead roll along
In your eyes
The option of a warm embrace implies
You're my friend
Happy endings keep our love alive


And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star

Want to be your main man in the big picture
What a deal
To get a part like this


Day to day
The shifting wind just blows us on our way
Here and there
Our pockets full of things to say
Oh my love
I proudly represent you in this world
Little satellite
Brightest star tonight, oh my love


And tell me do I fit in the big picture
Do I have a shot at the big part
'Cause I've been up all night looking at the big picture
I've got some good lines for my big star


Hope I got a future in the big picture
At the last embrace
From the first kiss

I was justified when I was five
Raising Cain, I spit in your eye
Times are changing, now the poor get fat
But the fever's gonna catch you when the bitch gets back 


Eat meat on Friday, that's alright
I even like steak on a Saturday night
I can bitch the best at your social do's
I get high in the evening sniffing pots of glue, ooh

Stone-cold sober, as a matter of fact

I've seen the bridge and the bridge is long
And they built it high and they built it strong
Strong enough to hold the weight of time
Long enough to leave some of us behind


And every one of us has to face that day
Do you cross the bridge or do you fade away
And every one of us that ever came to play
Has to cross the bridge or fade away


Standing on the bridge looking at the waves
Seen so many jump, never seen one saved
On a distant beach your song can die
On a bitter wind, on a cruel tide




And the bridge it shines
Oh cold hard iron
Saying come and risk it all
Or die trying

Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed 
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha


Well, I walk while they talk about virtue
Just raised on my back legs and snarled
Watched you kiss your old daddy with passion
And tell dirty jokes as he died
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha

But I'm damned when I really care there
For the cellar's the room in your lives
Where you lace yourself with bad whiskey
And close the cage doors on your life
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha



Well I pray while you bathe in bad water
Sing songs that I learnt as a boy
Then breaks all the bones in my body
On the bars you can never destroy
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha


Have you ever lived in a cage
Where you live to be whipped and be tamed 
For I've never loved in a cage
Or talked to a friend or just waved
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha
Ah-ah-ooh-ooh, ah-ah-ooh-ooh, oh, ah-ha


Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Oh-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh
Ah-ah-ah, oh-oh-oh, ah-ha
Hey, there


I see you tempt the night
I see you take a bite
You can tell me you were home
But the camera never lies

You walk out in disguise
To pull the wool over my eyes
You play me for a fool
To believe your alibis


And you can count on being safe as houses
Underestimate my eyes
But you can't argue with the image
The camera never lies

There's no distance put between us
Safe enough for you to hide
I'm watching all of your secrets
The camera never lies



I've been out here on this road some
Can't help feeling I've been showin' my friends around
I've seen it growin' from next to nothin'
Into a giant, eatin' up your town
Called up the tea leaves and the tarots
Asked the gypsy what she sees in the palm of our hands, oh yeah
She saw a mountain and wild deer runnin'
A crazy kid becoming a better man


But we stuck around for the fireworks
Waitin' to explode
Shaped our futures, you a tumbleweed
And me on a yellow brick road
Pleasin' the people some of the time
For better or for worse
An urban soul in a fine, silk suit
And a heart out west in a Wrangler shirt

And you can't go back
And if you try, it fails
Lookin' up ahead
I see a rusty nail
A sign hangin' from it
Sayin', "Truth for sale"
And that's what we did
No lies at all, just one more tale
About the captain and the kid


We've been missin', at times, in action
Can't imagine what he said he might do for you, oh yeah
The devil got to come to the party sometimes
But he never got to wear our shoes
Oh, we've conjured up what we created
Way back then, when I was standin' up in six-inch heels
Now you're ridin' off into the sunset
And I'm still spinnin' like a Catherine wheel


But we stuck around for the battle
Waitin' for a plan
To turn you into the brown dirt cowboy
And me into a rocket man
It pleases the people some of the time
Diggin' into our roots
But I got a brand new pair of shoes
And you're on a horse in old cowboy boots

For so many years, we've shared this path together
Kindred spirits in search of history
For you, the holy grail is where we come from
But it's a different road I crave these days for me

You dwell so on the dawn of our creation
And search for ghosts from our mythology
But for now, the wonders that the world can offer
Mean more to me than ancient family trees

To hear the waves pound the timbers of a snow 
Fighting off the coastline of Cape Horn
To travel in the shadow of the long boats
To where the giants of the artic were born

Where the dangers in the deep dark Congo river
Where the crocodile hunts and the python strikes
To watch another predator in action
Could rejuvenate some meaning in your life

A thrill to hunt in such exotic places
I can almost taste those beauties in Siam
The brown skin boys of Mykonos and Rangoon
The shy Chinese behind their painted fans

Took a high dive arcing out wide
Into the crowd
Out to the sound of their wild applause
But you've heard it before
And you've seen it all
From up there on the diving board


You'd free fall into the ether
Above the people
Out on a limb fragile and adored
But who below knows that
You're still a mystery
Way up on the diving board

Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me 
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise


But you beat the drum
You fell in love with it all
The planets alight
Those dizzy heights
And the view from the diving board


Took the grand prize you and your eyes
Butterfly light
Escaping the reach
Of their fangs and their claws
Such a pale little thing
In your lily-white skin
High up on the diving board


Sink or swim
I can't recall
Who said that to me 
When I was sixteen
And full of the world and its was noise

From the sunburned plains of far-off North Australia
Came a fella born to ride the wide, brown land
Oh, he grew up runnin' wild
But soon, by all, was styled
As the country's greatest-ever drovin' man


Oh, his legend rode the winds from Broome to Darwin
They loved and loathed him right from end to end
For when the drover gave his heart
To a girl whose skin was dark
From that day on, he was no white man's friend

So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, "The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home"


Then they called him up to fight for Mother England
In a far-off war that spilled his brothers' blood
Inside the jaws of Hell
Where both his brothers fell
He just watched his faith in man die in the mud


There was no hero's welcome for The Drover
Just a country that had turned its back on him
When he came home from the war
His sick wife, they were not pure
They let her die for the colour of her skin


So goes The Drover's story, you'll hear it near and far
And in the end, it's all he'll ever own
It says, "The outcast is a free man
If he sleeps under the stars
Makes the blanket of the southern skies his home"

Ahhh
La da da da da

Yeah yeah yeah
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah



I would lock you up but I could not bear to hear you
Screaming to be set free
I would chain you up if I'd thought you'd swear
The only one that mattered was me, me, me
I would strap you up but don't worry baby
You know I wouldn't hurt you unless you wanted me to
It's too late to stop, won't the heavens save me 
My daddy said, "The devil looks a lot like you"

Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
Take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
When the passion dies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is looking for a home

Yeah yeah yeah
La da da da da
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah



I'm like a maniac at the end of the day
I'm like a doggie barking at your door
So come and take me back to the place you stay
And maybe we can do it once more
I'm dangerous but don't worry, baby
I get excited at the things that you do
And there's a place for us in a dirty movie
'Cause no one does it better than me and you


Take me to the edge of heaven
Tell me that my soul's forgiven
Hide your baby's eyes and we can
Take me to the edge of heaven
One last time might be forever
Please don't tell me lies
It's just a matter of time before my heart is looking for a home

We bet on our lives and we bet on the horses
In that upstairs apartment
On Orlando and 4th
And the rent was due and the rent man was knocking
Like a Chinese proverb
We were always searching
Nightlife's a no-win but nobody noticed
How we killed off the bottles
Looking good on the surface
The dog days barked and the house cat got old
We were Bonnie and Clyde
In the emperor's new clothes


And the tears never came
They just stayed in our eyes
We refused to admit that we wore this disguise
Every inch of us growing
Like Pinocchio's nose
As we walked around in the emperor's new clothes


We flew by our wits and by the seat of our pants
In the state of illusion
In the nation of chance
And the repo was hauling the wreck we'd been driving
As the dashboard Madonna
Smiled back at us kindly
We cheated the system never batting an eyelid
Seeing only the good
Through the holes in our shoes
And our halos were rusty but we wore them proudly
We were two little gods
In the emperor's new clothes

And when we start we say forever
We say we care, we need, we feel
You read the movement of our eyes
But in our hearts we still believe
The end will come, before we know
The silent rule of love applies
We light the fuse and let it burn out
We just accept that love must die


And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us

No I won't believe the end will come for us

The end will come like sudden rain
The end is never what it seems
We sink the ship before we sail
We just accept what failure means


And so they say "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us

No I won't believe the end will come for us


And so they say, "The end will come for us"
And so the world slows down to let us off
Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us

Just hang it up and let it go, accept it if I must

But I don't believe, I don't believe, that the end will come for us

No I won't believe the end will come for usI watch the raindrops falling on my window pane
All the bloomed forget-me-nots won't falter in the rain
Electric light bulbs cannot replace the sun
And picture postcards can't reveal all the things we've done

And the flowers will never ever die
And the flowers will never die
And autumn in the country cannot withhold the sky
And the flowers will never die

He spreads his cloudy blanket on a raging sea
And calms the cruel waves with the help of powers that be
The hours fly by, the clock ticks on maneuvering its hands
While the autumn leaves fall from the trees and return into the landNone
Being wiry and thinking loudly
About the things sent to make you move
You can't help it, there's no one in the world
Knows you just, just the way you do


So we keep darting through the holes
As the hunter and the fox
Run the gauntlet's savage road


Winter's heavy and partly cloudy
And the snowfall leaves the tracks that catch a few
Bit if you're wiley, you will leave them lying
Snared up in the traps that they set for you
And it's an evergreen affair
As temptation taunts the fox
Into the hunter's waiting lair


And for mile after mile you'll never see me tire
You'll never see me slow down, for a while
Because I am the fox, like it or not


I'm always going to be there running over the rock
Yes I am the fox, a fascinating cross
Of sharp as a whip and tough as an ox
Yes I am the fox

Every night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart

The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine


I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time

Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine


I love you more than he

None
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance

In the sway of somber music
I shall never, never understand
Let me slip into the sweeter
Chorus of that other land
The gods love Nubia
The beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile
The gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia
Is only for the moment
The desolate the suffering
The plundered, the oppressed


The gods love Nubia
Their glorious creation
Its songs roll sweetly
Across the harvest plain


The tears of Nubia
A passing aberration
They wash into the river
And are never cried again


The gods love Nubia
We have to keep believing
The scattered and divided
We are still its heart
The fall of Nubia
Ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning
Though the flesh is torn apart
Take me in my dreams recurring
Cheerful as a childhood dance
Into one more taste of freedom
One more longing backward glance

In the sway of somber music
I shall never, never understand
Let me slip into the sweeter
Chorus of that other land

The gods love Nubia, the beautiful, the golden
The radiant, the fertile, the gentle and the blessed
The pain of Nubia is only of the moment
The desolate, the suffering, the plundered, the oppressed
The gods love Nubia, the glorious creation
The songs roll sweetly across the harvest plain
The tears of Nubia, a passing aberration
They wash into the river and are never cried again

The gods love Nubia, we have to keep believing
The scattered and divided, we are still it's heart
The fall of Nubia, ephemeral and fleeting
The spirit always burning though the flesh is torn apartPeering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that grip the rail
Wipe the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch

Whistle awaken someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore

Tread 'neath so small those little feet
Amid the morning a small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
It must be rewarded, must be displayed
Large hands lift him through the air
Excited eyes contain him there
The eyes of those he loves and knows
But what's this extra bed just here

His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing that makes
Strange sounds, strange sounds that sing

In those silent happy seconds that
Surround the sound of this event
A parent's smile is made in moments
They have made for you a friend

And all you ever learned from them
Until you grew much older
Did not compare with when they said
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
This is your brand new brother
Peering out of tiny eyes
The grubby hands that gripped the rail
Wiped the window clean of frost
As the morning air laid on the latch


A whistle awakened someone there
Next door to the nursery just down the hall
A strange new sound you never heard before
A strange new sound that makes boys explore


Tread neat so small those little feet
Amid the morning his small heart beats
So much excitement yesterday
That must be rewarded, must be displayed

But what's this extra bed just here 


His puzzled head tipped to one side
Amazement swims in those bright green eyes
Glancing down upon this thing
That make strange sounds, strange sounds that sing
Well, I could have been sick, I could have died
I could have given up and not tried
To make it to tomorrow
Like a broken hearted lover
But there was a brand new start
And suddenly I was taken
New and faraway places
And the music I was shaken
It was a whole new race
When I woke on that first day
There was nothing I could say
I was in the hands of angels
Johnny and the governor
Came and brought me to my senses
They made me feel just like a king
Made me lose all my bad defenses
And they knew all the places I needed to go
All of the people I needed to know
They knew who I needed, who needed me
And who would come help me and who would just let me be
I was in the hands of angels
Until this very day
Inside the hands of angels
What more can I say 
When you're in the hands of angels
Life is, oh, so sweet
And you feel the love down deep inside
Even out there on the street
In the hands of angels
In the heart of every girl
There's a woman waking up
Like sunlight spreads across the world
A smile for us is just enough
But in the heart of every girl
There's a homespun family dream
A light that's filled with so much joy
From a curly-head beauty to a teenage queen


And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl

In the heart of every girl
There's always room for Valentines
And boys to kneel and tip their hands
With words as sweet as summer wine
And in the heart of every girl
There is a rose for every spring
A peach that's fragrant and divine
She shines just like a wedding ring


And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl


Eyes can light up any room
The moment she steps in
Intoxicating everyone
A life alone should be a sin


And honeymoons in summer prove
We'll always love a bride
The gift you give us all
Is the one you hold inside
This lucky life, this crazy mixed up world
Is all because we love what lives
In the heart of every girl

No man's a jester playing Shakespeare
'Round your throne room floor
While the juggler's act is danced upon
The crown that you once wore


And sooner or later
Everybody's kingdom must end
And I'm so afraid your courtiers
Cannot be called best friends

Caesar's had your troubles
Widows had to cry
While mercenaries in cloisters sing
And the King must die


Some men are better slaying sailors
Take my word and go
But tell the ostler that his name was
The very first they chose


And if my hands are stained forever
And the altar should refuse me, yeah
Would you let me in, would you let me in, would you let me in 
Should I cry sanctuary

Yesterday you came to lift me up
As light as straw and brittle as a bird
Today i weigh less than a shadow on the wall
Just one more whisper of a voice unheard

Tomorrow leave the windows open
As fear grows please hold me in your arms
Won't you help me if you can to shake this anger
I need your gentle hands to keep me calm

`cause i never thought i'd lose
I only thought i'd win
I never dreamed i'd feel
This fire beneath my skin
I can't believe you love me
I never thought you'd come
I guess i misjudged love
Between a father and his son
Things we never said come together
The hidden truth no longer haunting me
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken
That kind of understanding sets me free

Dear Billy
I must seem a distant memory
Which is probably a good thing
And it will have been a long, long time
And I will have missed you growing
And I'll have missed you crying
And I'll have missed you laugh

Missed your stamping and your shouting
I have missed telling you off
But please, Billy, know that I was always there
I was with you through everything
And please, Billy, know that I will always be
Proud to have known you
Proud that you were mine
Proud in everything
And you must promise me this, Billy
In everthing you do
Always be yourself, Billy
And you always will be true
Love you forever
Love you forever

I'll just keep right on

NoneNoneThese battered hands are all you own
This broken heart just turned to stone
Go hang your glory on the wall
There comes a time when castles fall
And all that's left is shifting in the sand

You're out of time, you're out of place
Look at your face
That's the measure of a man

This coat that fits you like a glove
These dirty streets you learned to love
So welcome back my long lost friend
You've been to hell and back again
God alone knows how you crossed that span
Back on the beat, back to the start
Trust in your heart
That's the measure of a man

It's the fire in the eyes, the lines on the hand
It's the things you understand
Permanent ties from which you once ran
That's the measure of a man

You've come full circle, now you're home
Without the gold, without the chrome
And this is where you've always been
You had to lose so you could win
And rise above your troubles while you can

Now you can love, now you can lose
Now you can choose
That's the measure of a manNoneEverything is settled, immovable and calm
Nothing that has plagued our lives can ever do us harm
Then the voices railed against us, then the path was steep
Now the sounds are softer, now the road is ended
In your arms, I'll sleep

Turn away from madness, burn the inner light
Pray for me as cheerfully as I slip into the night
Death is just a visitor watching for a while
Sullen and predictable, love is versatile

Everything is peaceful, and falling into place
I no longer feel the wounds suffered in the chase
Then we were at turns divided, then by turns oppressed
Now the pain is over, now we lie together
Gratefully at rest

Put aside the notion that the end is near
Stay with me eternally, the terrors disappear
Death is just a messenger in a poor disguise
Fooling no one, lost for words, love is in your eyes

Now we know as we are known, unimagined things
Death is just the messenger, love the truth it brings
It's an honor and a privilege, a duty I perform
With due sense of decorum and with pride
With deference and great respect very much the norm
Plus a hint of sycophancy on the side
To lay before my ruler all the facts about his realm
To fill him in on all the beastly news


Yes, yes, Zazu, get on with it!


In order that His Majesty stands sturdy at the helm
Aware of all the fauna's latest views


Zazu! The morning report!


Er - yes, Sire: the morning report!


Chimps are going ape
Giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember
Though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up
Fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg
But I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills
And the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be
Coming back from lunch

Good morning, sire!


Good morning, Zazu!


Checking in with the morning report


Fire away!

Chimps are going ape
Giraffes remain above it all
Elephants remember
Though just what I can't recall
Crocodiles are snapping up
Fresh offers from the banks
Showed interest in my nest egg
But I quickly said, "No thanks!"
We haven't paid the hornbills
And the vultures have a hunch
Not everyone invited will be
Coming back from lunch

This is the morning report
Gives you the long and the short
Every grunt, roar, and snort
Not a tale I distort
On the morning report


What are you doing, son 


Pouncing...
When I can't find words and wisdom in my life
And barriers abound
Should I feel blinded by the light
Knee deep up to my neck in heavy water
I conjure up my muse
She's my means to achieve a simple quota

When it's make or break
Make no mistake
She appears like lightning in a bottle
I catch the spark
Oh she lights the dark
The knot's undone the ideas come
Like two hands on a throttle
There's a place of one way streets and doubt
No red lights ever change
We wind up with no exit out
Facts are facts and stumbling blocks delay the mind
That's when my muse arrives
Forgotten scars remind us of
Too much war, too little love
Beneath the fault-line truth to burn
Within the page so much to learn


Wounded birds look to us
Who can heal  Who to trust
Bring down the giants old and new
Strike up the band and waltz on through

I was shaking with a fever
When the last good horse went down
We were just a couple dancing
Where a thousand kings were crowned
Shaking with a fever
Before the white flag flew
And the ballroom opened up to us
And the dancers danced on through


Love in ruins, torn apart
Victims of the careless heart
Skating on the cold grey ice
Before the flood toward the light


Muddy boots to shiny shoes
Headlines screaming out the news
From dirt and damp to hardwood floors
Beyond the burned out broken walls

Have you seen the North
That cold grey place
Don't want its shadow anymore
On my face
A man grows bitter
We're a bitter race
Some of us never get to see
A better place
In the Northern Skies
There was a steel cloud
It used to follow me around
But I don't see it now
There's a farm in the rain
And a little farmhouse
There were a young man's eyes
Looking south


The North was my mother
But I no longer need her
You trade your roots and your dust
For a face in the river


And a driven rain that washes you
To a different shore
There's a North in us all
But my North can't hold me anymore

You can't always count on the prayers in your sleep
But this cold light's still killing me
If I pay the ransom
Well can they guarantee
To split the chains, slip the knots
I don't know if they'll ever set you free


I just can't rely on all these twisted signs
Too many bright lights turn you blind
The history of the blues
Seems to swim in your eyes
Pick yourself up, throw your head back
Take a long, long look into the sky


Are you out there, are you listening
Am I'm coming across to you
Is the North Star still shining
In the sky outside your room
You can listen but they're lying
Don't let them tell you
What you've always known
It's the North Star that's the big one
And it's always gonna lead you home

I saw you dancing out the ocean
Running fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flying from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit


And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby you're the one


There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man in his time is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long lost heart within his reach

I saw you dancin' out the ocean
Runnin' fast along the sand
A spirit born of earth and water
Fire flyin' from your hands
In the instant that you love someone
In the second that the hammer hits
Reality runs up your spine
And the pieces finally fit


And all I ever needed was the one
Like freedom fields, where wild horses run
When stars collide like you and I
No shadows block the sun
You're all I've ever needed
Baby, you're the one


There are caravans we follow
Drunken nights in dark hotels
When chances breathe between the silence
Where sex and love no longer gel, oh
For each man, in his time, is Cain
Until he walks along the beach
And sees his future in the water
A long, lost heart within his reach

You gotta think about it
You gotta make a wish and count to ten
There's just a sense of wonder
I feel a new direction looking down the lens
Jump started the action
Heard a song in my head and wrote it down
It came out of nowhere
Felt a new sensation driving you through town


You're an open chord I wanna play all day
A new broom sweeping up the sins I no longer play
Cleaning out the corners
Clipping out the horrors
That the Devil used to make me wear all day
You're an open chord I'm gonna play all day


You're gonna see some changes
Gotta pinch myself just to believe
Everybody's having something
But I can tell you've got some magic up your sleeve
Some deep protection
When a feeling follows you around
I always need the silence
Or the lightning you bring like a new good sound

Often these days
And always these nights
I find I'm afraid
Of the turbulent heights
No matter how crazily
No matter how far
The moments of tenderness
Are those where you are

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to calm down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
Once in a while
I slip back to my past
Where I long to remain
But the dream does not last
In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go

For when you are laughing
Like silver, like rain
You cool me, you soothe me
And love me again
For a few perfect hours
The world lets me be
You know how to break down
Oh oh
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me
The panic in me

In the trials of the present
No matter how low
You bring me such peace
And you won't let me go
Oh don't let me go

You know nothing about me and care even less
How could you understand our emptiness 
You've plundered our wisdom, our knowledge, our wealth
In bleeding us dry, you long for our spirit
But that, you will never possess

The past is now another land, far beyond my reach
Invaded by insidious foreign bodies, foreign speech
Where timeless joys of childhood lie broken on the beach
The present is an empty space between the good and bad
A moment's leading nowhere, too pointless to be sad
But time enough to lay to waste every certainty I had

The future is a barren world from which I can't return
Both heartless and material its wretched spoils, not my concern
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burn
Shining like an evil sun as my childhood treasures burn
You've more or less forgotten me this summer
And I can t hide my disappointment
I was on my way in the Phantom V
The one you gave away


I tried to tell you that I love you but I'm choked up
You forgot and that makes me feel like no one 
Were you ever really there  Did you ever really care 
Wait, I got so many examples of all of the good times we had
Long summer nights 
Held you long time, put your name in my rhyme
Refresh your memory of where you wanna be
The phantom's on the way, she s coming down the street

I tried to get to Atlanta
On a peach blossom highway
I tried to put these pauses out of mind
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world fell silent
I'll be waiting for you on the other side


Of summer lines 
Summer lines 
Summer lines
Every night
Summer lines


I tried to say I love you
But you didn't listen 
I tried to give you everything you might need 
In a sky made of diamonds
Where the world is flawless
I'll be waiting for you on the other side


Of summer lines 
Holding me for a long time 
Seems to me I'm in a dream
Behind these summer lines

I have sold myself through and through
I have walked in the darkness too
Felt a red sun, the living proof
Washed my hands in the honest truth
I have carried this weight time after time
I have bettered the dumb and the blind
I've seen dignity fail and colors run
Seen justice denied by the voice of a gun


And we walk, yes we walk
And we walk with the power every day
Never letting the light slip away
Reaching out, reaching in
Touching truth and touching skin
Never letting the light slip away
And we walk with the power every day


If my faith is a fire then burn baby burn
We've held fire long enough to learn
Heat beneath hope is a healing light
Kept alive by the flames of night
Walk tall in the power day after day
Never, never, never lose sight of the way
See the dawn come and the dusk hang
See the power rise from an open hand
There is still a little love left for me in your heart
Even though it seems to you that we are far apart
You can turn your eyes to other guys, ignore me on the street
But don't forget it's bound to show if we should ever meet

And there is still a little love left for me in your heart
You can use a little love to make a brand new start
For no matter how you try
You just cannot deny
There is still a little love in your heart

But you're far too proud to say what's on your mind
I can read you like a story book, do you think I'm blind
For every place I seem to be, you seem to be there too
Standing in the wings of love and waiting for your cueNone
There's no time for waiting
No future to see
Inside the next moment
Nothing might be
The answer is not certain
No time to decide
Is this the last curtain 
There's no place to hide


There's no tomorrow 
There's only today

We all know the story
We've heard it before
We end up no question
Outside of death's door
There's no easy answer
To the question at hand
So easy to ask
And not understand




There's only todayTurn towards the neon night
And watch the spectre of the night time
Read the sign killing time
And they can't see me, they can't see
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown

There's still time for me
With just a little help from you
There's still time for me
There's still time for me

The mist of the city has soaken through my clothes
The people who were there before were only there to gloat
Synthetic sounds around the town
Moaning bus queues all alone
Trying to find their own way home
Some are young and some are grown

Get some bitches on yo dick or keep that yee yee ass haircutNone
They laid beneath the pine trees
With their caps over their eyes
They were drunk with home and mama
As they brushed away the flies
In an instant
Before sunrise
They had gunned the rebels down
As their flags were torn at half mast
In the ruins of the town
There were white sails on the water
For the crippled on the beach
There was a lack of ammunition
So the cause was incomplete
When the bugle blew at breakfast
And they knew their ships were in
Signs of grand assurance
Were carried on the wind

Take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters
Must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks


They just chalked it down in history
But they kept their uniforms
They put their medals on the sideboards
And they went back to their farms
For it was just a mere reminder
That they stood beside the best
That God had saved the chosen few
And the devil took the rest


So take it home, take it low, take responsibilities
Came the message from the front
For the captains, captains quarters
Must retreat
Pack the compass, pack the tents, take the bunks


On the plains
Above the rock face
Where the sculptured eagles swoop
There's a haunted yell for action
Among the spectres of his troops
It was silent
On the coastline
As the crazy angels danced
To the sound of retreating footfall
From his military camp

'Til we find our place
On the path unwinding
In the Circle
The Circle of Life
Circle of Life!
This is the last time
I'll look across this table
And try to face a feeling I don't even recognize
This is a sad hand
That reached across and touched you
When all we'd built around us came crashing to the ground

There was a tide turning
Somewhere deep inside us
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears
Oh there were good times
But in between the dog days
I felt the pain of rumour whisper in my ears

But I still tried to love you
I still tried to care
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers
But you can't fight the rumour
You can't argue with you heart, no
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past

As the rain falls
I listen to the radio
And try to memorize the words to "Georgia On My Mind"
But we're no old song
We never stood the test of time
The lies inside the rumour left trust so far behind

In Orient where wise I was
To please the way I live
Come give the beggar chance at hand
His life is on his lip
Three score a thousand times
Where once in Amazon
Where Eldorado holds the key
No keeper holds my hand


Unchain the gate of solitude
The ruler says you run
Run hard unto the scaffold high
Your chance to jump the gun

 
Oh how high the scaffold grows
The plant life of your widow
In black lace curtains brought you near
From out the plate glass window


The Minotaur with bloody hands
Is enraged by the sun
Caged he by the corpses
Brought forth by the dawn
In Orient is as I told
The buckshee hangman swears
For open crypts to silence
Nylon knots to sway by prayer
Empty spaces - what are we living for 
Abandoned places - I guess we know the score
On and on, does anybody know what we are looking for...

Another hero, another mindless crime
Behind the curtain, in the pantomime
Hold the line, does anybody want to take it anymore 

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on
Whatever happens, I'll leave it all to chance
Another heartache, another failed romance
On and on, does anybody know what we are living for 

I guess I'm learning, I must be warmer now
I'll soon be turning, round the corner now
Outside the dawn is breaking
But inside in the dark I'm aching to be free

The show must go on
The show must go on
Inside my heart is breaking
My make-up may be flaking
But my smile still stays on

My soul is painted like the wings of butterflies
Fairy tales of yesterday will grow but never die
I can fly, my friends

The show must go on
The show must go on
I'll face it with a grin
I'm never giving in
On with the show

I'll top the bill, I'll overkill
I have to find the will to carry on
On with the...
On with the show
The show must go on


Through the dark, and
Through the hunger
Through the night and
Through the fear
Through the fight and
Years of hardship
Through the storms and
Through the tears
And although your feet are weary
And although your soul is worn
And although they'll try to break you
And although you'll feel alone
We will always stand together
In the dark, right through the storm
We will stand, shoulder to shoulder
To keep us warm

And the stars look down on the mean and hungry
And the stars look down and show the way
And the stars look down and we'll stand together
To see a day
When the stars look down and know our history
When the stars look down upon our past
And the stars look down and see a future bright at last
When we'll stand as one, beneath the sun

How can this be
This devil leaves
And god abandons me
I'm left here looking at these flames
That too could set me free

The vessel that I used to be
Is tainted now and ripped apart
Bathed in madness by that fiend
Who's robbed me of my human heart

To contemplate this crimson hell
Is more than I can stand
Did I send so to seal my fate
Offered up by hell's own hand

For here, I am a thing of darkness
Thrown from this ungodly swoon
Immortal from a savage kiss
Kept from my eventual doom

But wait, did I invite this fate
This invitation from the damned
This introduction to the dark
Was never in my mortal plan
Can you hear the floorboards crying
In a room on the second floor
That used to be owned by someone who's no one
But he don't live there anymore

Only Rebecca clasping her head in her knees
Trying to work out what it's about
And why someone had to leave

But dry up your tears
Stop counting the years
Don't worry what's coming
Forget all your fears
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
And the tide will turn for Rebecca
Her life will change
Her hopes rearrange
Into something that might really matter

She's all alone in a world of her own
With a key that fits her lonely world
You won't need a crowd to shout out aloudNone
People say I'm the life of the party
'Cause I tell a joke or two
Although I might be laughing loud and hearty
Deep inside I'm blue


So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears

Woo, I need you 
Need you 


Since you left me, if you see me with another girl
Seeming like I'm having fun
Although she may be cute, she's just a substitute
'Cause you're the permanent one


So take a good look at my face
You'll see my smile looks out of place
If you look closer it's easy to trace
The tracks of my tears 


 Oh, I need you 
I need you 


Oh, baby, now
Outside, I'm masquerading 
Inside my hope is fading 
I'm just a clown since you put me down
My smile is my makeup
I wear since my break-up with you
Baby, baby, baby, baby

Look out new world here we come
Brave, intrepid and then some
Pioneers of maximum
Audacity whose resumes
Show that we are just the team
To live where others merely dream
Building up a head of steam
On the trail we blaze


Changing legend into fact
We shall ride into history
Turning myth into truth
We shall surely gaze
On the sweet unfolding
Of an antique mystery
All will be revealed
On the trail we blaze


Paradise is close at hand
Shangri-la the promised land
Seventh heaven on demand
Quite unusual nowadays
Virgin vistas, undefiled
Minds and bodies running wild
In the man behold the child
On the trail we blaze

Some days I think it's all a dream
The things I've done, the places that I've been
This life of mine seemed surreal at times
Wasted days and nights in someone else's mind
Could it be I'm not for real 
I've slapped my face to check out how I feel
There's hostages to prove it's true
Who lives behind the mask was never proved


Come on Robert Johnson
Though we're worlds apart
You and I know what it's like
With the devil in our heart
You sold your soul at the crossroads
Kept a little of mine on hand
I'm wading out this muddy water
Been stranded in the Wasteland


Rattling chains all around my bed
Ghosts can laugh but they're already dead
I'm not dying and I'm far from gone
The blues man spent his candle but his pain lives on

Are you still in control of the boat that you row
Or do you still cling to me when it's sinking 
I never condemned you, I only consoled you
When candlelight made me a king


For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind


And the hearts that you played on the porch swing for me
Was a song that I'd heard in the past
For I had an audience somewhere inside you
That applauded whenever you laughed


For the wide-eyed and laughing
Passed like a season
Erasing a passion to sin
For no one knew better than the tea leaves and the tarots
That the wide-eyed and laughing
Were just one step ahead of the wind
Ooh, ahead of the wind

Whoo!
Now, listen up


We were running wild, and so reviled
Raisin' cain until we got exiled
But times are changing
Now we're on the attack
Yeah, the spell is gonna hit 'cha
'Cause the witches are back
Who-oh-oh
Sistasth!

Yeah, the witches, the witches
The witches are back
Stone cold sinner as a matter of fact
I'm a witch, I'm a witch
But i'm better than you
Watch the way that we fly
The way that you'll die
Who-oh-oh 


Yeah, the witches, the witch s
The witches are back
Ston  cold meanies as a matter of fact
Yeah, the witches, the witches
Are coming for you
With the spells that we cast
My, this tempo is fast
Who-oh-oh



Witch, witch
The witches are back 
Witch, witch 
The witches are back, back
The witch, witch 
The witches are back 
Witch, witch 
The witches are back, back
The witches are back!None
She threw back that shiny hair
Like the mane on a delta queen
Gonna spend my last dime on a telephone call
Because she's the wildest thing I've ever seen
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood


Now they call her the cat
And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the cat

She just does that double act
She got babs and joan down pat
She got hips like mick, she's a rolling stone
Never seen a woman shake like that
She was just plain mister once
Got herself fixed up real good
Just a little boy lost in the land of the free
A wiggle and a walk away from womanhood




She's so fine that the water line
Don't separate hot and cold
She got stitched up bitchy by an old m.D
Now she's headed out to Hollywood or so I'm told




And that's a stone fact
They took a little of this
She got a little of that
Now billy got a kitty
He got something to scratch
So they call her, yeah they call her the catNoneI'm getting bored
Being part of mankind
There's not a lot to do no more
This race is a waste of time
People rushing everywhere
Swarming around like flies
Think I'll buy a .44
Give 'em all a surprise

I think I'm gonna kill myself
Cause a little suicide
Stick around for a couple of days
What a scandal if I died
Yeah, I'm gonna kill myself
Get a little headline news
I'd like to see what the papers say
On the state of teenage blues

A rift in my family
I can't use the car
I gotta b  in by ten o'clock
Who do they think they ar  
I'd make an exception
If you wanna save my life
Brigitte Bardot gotta come
And see me every night

Tune me in to the wild side of life
I'm an innocent young child, sharp as a knife
Take me to the garretts where the artists have died
Show me the courtrooms where the judges have lied
Let me drink deeply from the water and the wine
Light colored candles in dark dreary mines
Look in the mirror and stare at myself
And wonder if that's really me on the shelf


And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune

Take me down alleys where the murders are done
In a vast high powered rocket to the core of the sun
Want to read books in the studies of men
Born on the breeze and die on the wind
If I was an artist who paints with his eyes
I'd study my subject and silently cry
Cry for the darkness to come down on me
For confusion to carry on turning the wheel


And each day I learn just a little bit more
I don't know why but I do know what for
If we're all going somewhere, let's get there soon
Oh, this song's got no title, just words and a tune
It's closing time the boys are all together at the bar
Staring in their glasses
Looks like another layoff at the yard
Yesterday I heard union hall come down
They hit it with a wrecking ball
And they try but nothing changes in this town


Cap in hand stood in line
Your family ties are the chains that bind
The endless wheel goes round and round
Chances are you'll never leave this town
Oh oh no

Like a river now the empty streets are flooded out with rain
It's falling on the playground
While the kids get wet playing the same old games
Locked away so many things remind them of war
They tap the pavement with their canes
The good old days ain't so good no more


You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure
All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore


You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
And if you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff
All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em, as they say, and weep
I never felt enough to cry


I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles headin' west
Pickin' up my pain from door to door
Ridin' on the storyline, furnace burnin' overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
You may not believe it
But I don't believe in miracles anymore
And when I think about it
I don't believe I ever did for sure

All the things I've said in songs
All the purple prose you bought from me
Reality's just black and white
The sentimental things I'd write
Never meant that much to me
I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the storyline
Furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore

You don't need to hear it
But I'm dried up and sick to death of love
If you need to know it
I never really understood that stuff

All the stars and bleeding hearts
All the tears that welled up in my eyes
Never meant a thing to me
Read 'em as they say and weep
I've never felt enough to cry

I used to be the main express
All steam and whistles heading west
Picking up my pain from door to door
Riding on the storyline
Furnace burning overtime
But this train don't stop
This train don't stop
This train don't stop there anymore
Loving you was easy
Your love captured my heart
You were always pleasing
Till you tore us apart
Said you needed both of us
How could you be so unkind
Then you traded love for lust
But sooner or later I'm gonna get you
Look out girl 'cause I'm gonna fix you

I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
I'm gonna shake it up
This time I'm gonna break it up
There won't be any making up
I'm shaking this three-way love affair
Sneaking out on Sunday
You thought I didn't know
Well early morning Monday
Once more you didn't show
Alibis and selfish lies
Oh I've had my fill of them all
You can dry your crying eyes
I know you're faking, there's no mistaking
Look out girl your heart might be breaking
Oh, oh, oh, oh yeah yeah yeah
Ooh, yeah yeah, oh
Ooh baby
Ooh baby, mmm


In this world it's hard, you know
Lovers come and lovers go
People never seem to hold on to what they've got, no no
Some they never stay together
You and I will be no better
We can make it last forever
We can keep this love alive


Through the storm
Through the tears
You and I
I know we can survive
To the day
Through the night
If we try we can keep it alive
We can keep it alive


I know sometimes it's been so tough
We've been so close to giving up
Hey, but our love's so strong
And we keep holding on, yeah
To what we got, ooh ooh ooh
It's easier to walk away
It takes a lot of love to stay
Ah, we've got all the love it takes
We know there's a brighter day

Yo, Gee, they can't stop me from rapping, can they 
Can they, Hop 


Through the fire, to the limit, to the wall
For a chance to be with you
I'd gladly risk it all
Through the fire
Through whatever, come what may
For a chance at loving you
I'd take it all the way
Right down to the wire
Even through the fire


I drink a Boost for breakfast, an Ensure for dessert
Somebody ordered pancakes, I just sip the sizzurp
That right there could drive a sane man berserk
Not to worry, Mr. H-to-the-Izzo's back to wi-zerk
How do you console my mom or give her light support
Telling her her son's on life support 
And just imagine how my girl feel
On the plane, scared as hell that her guy look like Emmett Till
She was with me before the deal, she'd been trying to be mine
She a Delta, so she'd been throwing that Dynasty sign
No use in me tryin' to be lyin', I been tryin' to be signed
Tryin' to be a millionaire, how I used two lifelines
In the same hospital where B.I.G. and 2Pac died
The doctor said I had blood clots, but I ain't Jamaican, man
Story on MTV and I ain't trying to make a band
I swear this right here, history in the making, man

Ain't no loving tonight
My woman says she ain't my woman
I sure put up a fight to keep it right
I used a whole lot of pride to get her
I used a whole pack of lies and begged her
She just threw me the key and said she's free


Thunder in the night, thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night, thunder in the night again
Thunder in the night again


Frightening lightning hit me again
It's burning much deeper this time
I got them storm clouds hanging right over my head
And it's going to rain harder this time


Thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder


Out here searching the streets
I got to find my woman and tell her
I never wanted to cheat, but she cheated me
I never knew just how much I loved her
I never knew till I went and lost her
Now it's all too late, she's gone away

"An extremely quiet child" they called you in your school report
"He's always taken interest in the subjects that he's taught"
So what was it that brought the squad car screaming up your drive
To notify your parents of the manner in which you died 


At St. Patrick's every Sunday, Father Fletcher heard your sins
"Oh, he's unconcerned with competition, he never cares to win"
But blood stained a young hand that never held a gun
And his parents never thought of him as their troubled son


"Now you'll never get to Heaven," Mama said
Remember Mama said
Ticking, ticking
"Grow up straight and true blue
Run along to bed"
Hear it, hear it, ticking, ticking


They had you holed up in a downtown bar screaming for a priest
Some gook said, "His brain's just snapped" then someone called the police
You'd knifed a Negro waiter who had tried to calm you down
Oh, you'd pulled a gun and told them all to lay still on the ground
Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
Someday our ocean
Will find its shore

So I'll leave the ways that are making me be
What I really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making me love
What I really don't want to love
Time has told me
You came with the dawn
A soul with no footprint
A rose with no thorn

Your tears they tell me
There's really no way
Of ending your troubles
With things you can say

And time will tell you
To stay by my side
To keep on trying
'Till there's no more to hide

So leave the ways that are making you be
What you really don't want to be
Leave the ways that are making you love
What you really don't want to love

Time has told me
You're a rare rare find
A troubled cure
For a troubled mind

And time has told me
Not to ask for more
For some day our ocean
Will find its shore
Nostradamus said, "I predict
That the world will end at half past six"
What he didn't say was exactly when
Was he listening to the radio 
Was he listening to the government 
Well he got us spooked anyway
We'd been running hot up until today
But a wind of change blew across our sales
We were coasting on a winning streak
We were kings until the power failed

We've been living in a tinderbox
And two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox 
Two sparks can set the whole thing off
Rubbing up together around the clock
Lately we've been getting more roll than rock
You and me together in a tinderbox


Godzilla came in disguise
Tore the building down right before our eyes
Kept the needle out of the red balloon
Was he worried we might go too far
Maybe wind up rhyming moon and June
The sun descends down in Mexico
While a fancy car back on Savile Row
Shows the price of fame leads to overkill
Things are going to have to change
Some holes along the road get filled




Pressure's going to cook us if we don't unlock it
Gun's going off if we don't uncock it
We've got to climb out of the other one's pocket
Or we're going to burn, out on this beautiful rocket

It's all so pointless, hah
It's not tho is it, because
It's really real 
And when you feel it 
You can really feel it
So grab somebody that you love
Grab anyone that needs to hear it 
And shake them by the shoulders softly
Scream in their face so slowly
There's no way they could possibly miss it

Yelled: Here's a song
Here's a little punk rock song for you
A little punk rock called
I think it was written by the Ramones
In the early 70's
Maybe before they started
You know, when it was really hard core back in the old days
Remember 
Flea
I could have sworn this was the Dead Kennedy's

No no no no no
I think it was Sham 69
No, this is the Buzz-cocks


You idiot, you worthless peon
Don't you know this is one of the
It must have been, um
The Sex Pistols


No, this is Non Non Non
Hey, it was the Church or the Weirdos maybe

I'm falling so please just don't let go

C's
Mr Munk is immaculate
I ain't stylish, I'm sky-lish, yes, my levels so up there
My lady's adjacent, I smell her fragrance
And whats under my Armanis goes up there
Now I'm in the mood, full salute
No bubberoose, just apple juice
And she ain't ever got to tell me hold her closer
Cause the girls on the trol ain't getting closer
Munk

You're my star, my light, my whole entire life
Without you was bleary and I can't see why
My friends said "James, are you feeling alright "
And I just think that I'm dreaming all night
When I'm with you I feel I've been saved
And I wanna thank your mum and dad for what they made
So I'm just wanna say I'm gonna keep you
For life, 24/7 I hope too


Hold you closer and don't let go
I need to know how you feel too
So hold me closer and don't let go
I'm falling so please, girl, don't let go


Hold me closer, tiny dancer 
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen 
You had a busy day today 


Verse 2, it's Ironik, you're my perfect dream, we're the perfect team
I'm the king, you're the queen, you're the book that I read
Without you, it feels like there's no me
And that's why it's you that I just wanna keep
How many times have I told you that I love you 
So many times, you know I wanna hug you
So come and show me what love means
Cause I don't really know, I've just seen it in my dreams, I swear

Hold me closer, tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
You had a busy day today

Be still I say, for you excell
In virtues common in the infidel
Mongrel bitch who feels compelled
To twist the rules to suit herself!

Do you look at me and see a fool 
Do we look like men for the likes of you 
What possesses you to cross that line
When you know what it means to kill your kind 

No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind

No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind


This d mon rides a carousel
She would swing high and low on th  gates of hell
But the rats in the gutter pick the chick from the floor!
Make a dog, play the role of a common whore!

So look at me and squirm inside
Do you think in this world there's a place to hide 
From the Ancient Ones to the next in line
It's always been a sin to kill your kind!


No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind

No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind
No greater crime than to kill your kind
Tonight
Do we have to fight again
Tonight 
I just want to go to sleep
Turn out the light
But you want to carry grudges
Oh, nine times out of ten
Oh, I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling
Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing
Tonight 
Oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
Oh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time
Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile
Who'd love to see you smile
Tonight

Tonight
Do we have to fight again 
Tonight
I just wanna go to sleep
Turn out the light
But you wanna carry grudges
Oh, nine times outta ten
Mmm, I see the storm approaching
Long before the rain starts falling


Tonight
Does it have to be the old thing 
Tonight
Oh, it's late, too late
To chase the rainbow that you're after
I'd like to find a compromise
Ooh, and place it in your hands
My eyes are blind, my ears can't hear
Oh, and I cannot find the time


Tonight
Just let the curtains close in silence
Tonight
Why not approach with less defiance
The man who'd love to see you smile 
Who'd love to see you smile tonight

Six o'clock alarm
I get the wake up call
Let that sucker jingle-jangle
Ring right off the wall
I'm too low for zero
I'm too tired to work
Tied one on with a friend last night
And wound up losing my shirt


I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

Cutting out cups of coffee
Switching off the late night news
Putting the cat out two hours early
It isn't any use
I'm too low for zero
Insomnia attacks
Watching flies with my eyes till sunrise
It's daylight when I hit the sack


I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep
I'm too low for zero
I wind up counting sheep
Nothing seems to make much sense
It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero


I'm too low for zero
I'm on a losing streak
I got myself in a bad patch lately
I can't seem to get much sleep

It's all just Greek to me
You know I'm too low, too low, too low for zero

Did you see the first man on the moon 
Have you seen the first light of day 
When there wasn't someone stuck inside
Something like the moon
Something like a star that's lost its way
Did you go to Dallas on that day 
Have you been to where they broke a dream 
Where there really isn't room for doubt 
Somehow we got lost
And the truth is buried somewhere in between

And everyone, everywhere
Take time and dry your eyes
Because too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried
Just look into that beautiful blue
That beautiful blue, blue sky
And know too many tears, too many tears
Have been cried


The mystery of why they had to leave
I'm only one of thousands saying why
Why a balcony in Memphis, Tennessee
Seems trapped in time
Just an angry finger pointing at the sky
Would you wait to stand inside his shoes 
And is the best all you have to give
The barefoot man lived a simple life
I guess he knew
Some things die so other things might live


Your mother's eyes look straight through me
Whenever we meet
Your father swears it'll never be
As long as he breaths
And how many times have they told you
That you're too young
How, how I've ached to hold you
But you're too young


If we don't buy what's right or wrong
Then we are sinners
We were never two to tag along
But we were always winners
And how many people, have told you
That you're too young
And how many jealous hands would love to hold you
Because you're too young


Well you're too young to love me
And I'm too old for you
At least that's what they tell us
It's in their book of rules
That you're too young, too young baby you're too young
We could try it for a while
But they'd get us in the long run
They say that you're too young, baby you're too young
None
Snow, cement
And ivory young towers
Someone called us Babylon
Those hungry hunters tracking down the hours


But where were all your shoulders when we cried 
Were the darlings on the sideline
Dreaming up such cherished lies
To whisper in your ear before you die 

It's party time for the guys in the tower of Babel
Sodom meet Gomorrah, Cain meet Abel
Have a ball y'all
See the letches crawl with the call girls under the table
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel
Watch them dig their graves
'Cause Jesus don't save the guys
In the tower of Babel, no, no, no


Junk, angel
This closet's always stacked
The dealers in the basement
Filling your prescription for a brand new heart attack


But where were all your shoulders when we cried 
Were the doctors in attendance
Saying how they felt so sick inside
Or was it just the scalpel blade that lied 


I'll say it again this is not my city
I don't belong looking for a town of plenty
There weren't these thieves
We had some thing in common
Goals to achieve
We had some thing in common
In a town of plenty


Can't you see it, this is not my writing
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty

And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip
Were the passports and the luggage
I came looking for a town of plenty


I'll say it again, this is not my city
I only asked if this was a town of plenty
There were many archives
We had no media
Only art survived there
Yeah we had no media
In a town of plenty


And laid across the airstrip

All that once remained
Of a rugged individual
And laid across the airstrip

I came looking for a town of plenty
737 coming out of the sky
Won't you take me down
To Memphis on a midnight ride 


I want to move, yeah
Playing in a travelling band, yeah
Well, I'm flying across the land
Trying to get a hand
Playing in a travelling band

Take me to the hotel
Baggage gone, oh well
Come on, come on
Won't you get me to the room 




Listen to the radio
Talking about the last show
Someone got excited
Had to call the state militia




Here we come again on a Saturday night
With your fussing and your fighting
Won't you get me to the right




Well, I'm playing in a travelling band
Playing in a travelling band
Well the train I ride
Is leaving the station
And the train I ride
To my destination

I was walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I was walking
Now I've got me a ride

Well I got no need
For no company
Got my blues guitar
That's all I need

I ain't walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride

Think I've come to
The end of my song
If you feel you want to
Why don't you sing along

I ain't walking
Now I'm travelin' in style
I ain't walking
Now I've got me a ride

Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feelin' far above par
Oh, how lucky we are
While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on, it will always be
True love, true love
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true
For you and I have a guardian angel
On high with nothin' to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love, forever true
Love, forever true


Give me your true love, oh yeah
True love, true love
Got to give me your true love
Oh yeah, oh yeah
True love,  true love 
Suntanned, windblown
Honeymooners at last alone
Feeling far above par
Oh, how lucky we are

While I give to you and you give to me
True love, true love
So on and on it will always be
True love, true love

For you and I have a guardian angel
On high, with nothing to do
But to give to you as you give to me
Love forever, true
Love forever, true
Give me more true love
Oh yeah
True love, true love Gotta give me your true love
Oh yeah
True love, true loveLooking back it makes me shiver
Don't be scared to kick the past
Selling lovers down the river
Nothing built for speed will last overnight

All those years of desolation
Pretty boys and damage done
Not the way to find salvation
Looking after number one

Trust me
Try rolling with the flow
Trust me
I've been there don't you know
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, you're naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust me

Too many years your heart has wandered
Scared to make a final move
Too many nights those boys have squandered
You got nothing left to prove

Trust Me
Trust Me
I'm giving you a chance, so take it
I got all you want, you'll make it
Standing there in front of me, butt naked
You can't hide a thing, you've got no choice
Trust Me
Trust Me
None
Your bags out on the bed
Your closet's all cleared out
You say you're going to jacksonville
Because our love's all worn out
You're searching in my eyes
To try and find a tear
But the well of my forgiveness
Has dried up with the years


You might still look pretty
In that lacey little dress
But I think you've got your signals crossed
If you think that I'm a mess

I am not going to die, I am not going to cry
I won't wear my heart out on my sleeve
You can take the car, but you won't break my heart
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave
I am not going to going to shake, I am not going to break
I am not going to fall down on my knees
So if everything's been said I'm heading back to bed
Oh and darling turn the lights out when you leave


It's like a prime time movie
You play the part so well
You do believe you're Heaven sent
And living here is hell
I hear it's hot in Florida
And it's raining here tonight
But the sun going to shine tomorrow
And I'm going to do alright






Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me
Turn to me, turn to me when you're lonely
Brush them aside, gather your pride
Baby turn to me

Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name
I know it hurts
But baby I've had it too

I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me

Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
The people they pretend that company is bright
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't bury your hopes, there's nothing that's left for you to confide in

But you seem to be happy just for now to go on
Try to see through them baby, can't you see what is wrong
You're hurting yourself more that you'll ever knowTurn to me, turn to me
When you're lonely;
Brush them aside, gather your pride
And baby, turn to me

Turn to me, turn to me
When you're lonely;
Brush them aside, gather your pride
And baby, turn to me

Don't listen to the people
Who spread lies about your name;
I know it hurts, but baby I've had it too;
I've learned to live with their abuse
I've learned to live with those who choose
To disregard my emptiness and lose me
Your laughter has died in the heat of the night
And the people, they pretend that your company is bright;
But brighter you'll wait by the phone that has died
Don't build up your hopes
There's no one that's left for you to confide inNoneChorus]
Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah-bam-boom

Got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
Got a gal named Sue, she knows just what to do
She rocks me to the east, she rocks me to the west
She's the gal that I love best

Tutti frutti oh rooty, tutti frutti oh rooty, tutti frutti oh rooty
Tutti frutti oh rooty, tutti frutti oh rooty
Wop-bom-a-loowah, belah- wow!Twentieth century blues are getting me down
Blues, escape those dreary twentieth century blues
Why, if there's a god in the sky, why shouldn't he grin
High above this dreary twentieth century din

In this strange illusion, chaos and confusion
People seem to lose their way
What is there to strive for, love or keep alive for
Say, Hey hey, call it a day

Blues, nothing to win or to lose, it's getting me down
Blues, escape those weary twentieth century blues

Why is it that civilized humanity can make this world so wrong
In this hurly-burly of insanity, our dreams cannot last long
We've reached a deadline, a press headline, every sorrowNone
Through a mutual agreement, we got that aching feeling
To look up one another one more time
Tracking down the zip codes
Sealing down those envelopes
Lack of communication on the telephone line
But don't judge us by distance
Or the difference between us
Try to look at it with an open mind
For where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world
Well we've both ridden the wagon bit the tail off the dragon
Borne our swords like steel knights on the highway
Washing down the dirt roads
Hosing off our dirty clothes
Coming to terms with the times that we couldn't but we tried


Where there is one room, you'll always find another
Two rooms at the end of the world


Door to door they would whisper, will they ever get together
Their rooms are different temperatures I'm told
There's a change in their thinking
And their habits seem uneven
But together the two of them were mining gold
I remember when rock was young
Me and Suzy had so much fun
Holding hands and skipping stones
Had an old gold chevy and a place of my own
But the biggest kick I ever got
Was doing a thing called the crocodile rock
While the other kids were rocking round the clock
We were hopping and bopping to the crocodile rock Well...

Hold me closer tiny dancer
Count the headlights on the highway
Lay me down in sheets of linen
Ya had a busy day today
And I think it's gonna be a long long time
Til touchdown brings me round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh, no, no, no
I'm a rocket man
Rocket man, burning out his fuse up here alone

Shine the light, shine the light
Shine the light won't you shine the light
Philadelphia freedom I love love love you
Yes I do

But you misread my meaning when I met you
Closed the door and left me blinded by the light
Don't let the sun go down on me
Although I search myself it's always someone else I see
I'd just allow a fragment of your life to wander free
Cause losing everything is like the sun going down on me

But I'm still standing better than I ever did
Looking like a true survivor feeling like a little kid
I'm still standing yeah, yeah, yeah

And it seems to me you lived your life like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to when the rain set in
And I would've liked to have know you but I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before your legend never did

Rolling over trying to sleep
And understanding women
Thinking of you out there somewhere
Looking for a new beginning


Just let me be the final word
In the book we haven't written
I won't be another page
In understanding women

I could drive to Mexico
On understanding women
Throw myself against the waves
And answer up to heaven
How come her heart's so stubborn
And what's so wrong with giving
Ask the big sky talking
About understanding women
And I'm not just anyone who ever stood outside your door
And I'm not any man you've ever known before
Don't judge this picture by the frame
Every man is not the same
Some men reach beyond the pain
Of understanding women

There's nowhere in the world that
I would rather be than with you my love
And there's nothing in the world that
I would rather see than your smile my love


For united we stand, divided we fall
And if our backs should ever be against the wall
We'll be together, together, you and I



And if the world about you falls apart
My love, then I'll still be here
And if the going gets too hard along
The way, just you call, I'll hear


There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Just as fast as my feet can fly
Come away, come away if you're going
Leave the sinking ships behind


Come on to rise and win
We're going up around the bend


Bring a song and a smile for the banjo
Better get while the getting's good
Hitch a ride to the end of the highway
Where the neon's prime to wood



You can ponder perpetual motion
It's your mind on a crystal day
Always time for a good conversation
There's an ear for what you say




Catch a ride to the end of the highway
And we'll meet by the big red tree
There's a place up ahead and I'm going
Come along, come along with me


The seadogs have all sailed their ships
Into the docks of dawn
While the sirens sit and comb their hair
And twiddle with their thumbs
Oh Thor above the mountain
Look down upon your children
This is their heaven where they're told
To bring their galleons
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings


You can come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala
Come to Val-hala in your own time
Come to Val-hala seek and you will find Val-hala


There's long boats in the harbor
Which arrive there every hour
With the souls of the heroes
Whose blood lies on the flowers
And this heaven is the home
Of every man who loves his sword
And he uses it for freedom
To preach the word of Thor
Seek you find your place with me
Men of iron, men of steel
Only the brave hear the hammers ring
In the courts of the Queens, in the halls of the Kings

Bleib hier bei mir, la  uns noch mal dr ber schlafen

Verzeih mir zu sagen ist so schwer

Bitte versuch mich zu verstehen
Und komm mir entgegen, wenn du kannst

Ich habe solche Angst, ich finde den Weg nicht mehr
Verzeih mir zu sagen ist so schwer
You said you'd never fake it, you swore we'd always make it last
And it sounded so real and I fell into your love trap
Blind, yes, I was the perfect fool
I believed every word and it never occurred to me


Is this a game 
Are you just playing 
Will I be losing you 

Oh, am I a victim of love, victim of love, did you take me for a ride 
Victim of love, victim of love, then I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love, were you only using me 
Victim of love, victim of love, what a fool you made of me


My friends warned me about you, I laughed
How could I doubt your love, then I saw you with him
My world crumbled around me, I felt life slip away from me
There's a void inside me where my heart used to be


So now this was a game
You were just playing
And now I'm losing you


Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love, and I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love, you were only using me
Victim of love, victim of love, what a fool you made of me


Oh, I'm a victim of love, victim of love, you took me for a ride
Victim of love, victim of love, and I hope you're satisfied
Victim of love, victim of love, you were only using me
Victim of love, victim of love, what a fool you made of me

I'm looking, I'm looking back
I'm trying to imagine this and that
The simple mathematics making up the map
Insurance of protection from immediate collapse
I'm watching, I'm watching you
A voyeur from a different point of view
The solitary eyes that I've been looking through
Committed to connecting the old ways to the new
And I see things
Through a curtain blowing back against the rain
Through the crack in a door that heaves with pain
And through every gap that gives away
Some secret in the dark
I'll come away with something
To keep you in my heart
I'm searching, I'm setting out
To prove without a shadow of a doubt
The age-old contradiction that's hovering about
A whisper in the darkness
Holds more truth than a shout
I'm waiting, I'm waiting for
Telltale footsteps on the bedroom floor
A broken hearted lover simply looking for
Relief that's temporary from her dirty little war
And I see things
From the ceilings of a hundred hotel rooms
From a satellite that's bouncing off the moon
And from every telescope
That's focused in on someplace dark
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart
Yes I see things
From the highest branch that looks directly in
Through a hawk's eyes gliding silent on the wind
And in every secret rendezvous where illicit lovers park
I'll come away with something to keep you in my heart

Voyeur Got this bug-eyed girl
Cold hand on my knee
Frozen teeth chitter, chatter
She's dressed up like a cemetery
Like a cemetery

Snowbound all winter
Blue lips on my cheek
Little tongues prattlin', rattlin'
Talkin' about them hometown geeks
Them hometown geeks

Wake up Wendy, smell the coffee
Help me into your custom kitchen
Gimme a cup of that old black magic
I want to get me some of that old home cookin'
Can you feel it, it's chilly and freezin'
Wake up Wendy, moods a changin'
I got a reason, and you got a feelin'
Wake up Wendy, love's in season

Feels like a steam clean
When she washes me
Clouds a bustin', pumps a hissin'
Just peel me off the ceiling
Off the ceiling

Ladies and gentlemen, the hardest working man in show business, Mr. Elton John!

Walking
My head in the air
Each step I take
Is a step over trouble
Emotions are gone
There's no analyzing
Time can go endlessly on
All is alive
That I see before me
The more I know
The more you can show me
Sky over land
And land under ocean
Time can go endlessly on
For at time
I need someone
To take me anywhere
On my own
I wander
I have no need to care

Walking
Nobody passing by
Each step I take
Is a step over troubles
Gently I fly
Through clouds of emotion
Time can go endlessly on
City boy, city girl
Arm in arm in our city world
A lot of love, a lot of hope
Hope our love don't go up in smoke


I feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine

Warm love in a cold world, warm love in a cold world
Hope we're going to make it, hope we're going to make it
Warm love in a cold world, warm love in a cold world
Girl, we got to make it, girl, we got to make it
Warm love in a cold world
Sure we're going to make it, sure we're going to make it
Sure we're going to make it, we're going to make it


Never knew, but thanks to you
I'm finding out just what love can do
You picked me up, I've come alive
I'm seeing life in another light


Feel so good, yeah I feel so fine
I know I'm yours and I know you're mine
Feeling good, yeah I'm feeling fine
Now you're mine, now you're mine, now you're mine


Warm love in a cold world, warm love in a cold world
Hope we're going to make it, hope we're going to make it
Warm love in a cold world, warm love in a cold world
Girl, we got to make it, girl, we got to make it
Warm love in a cold world
Sure we're going to make it, sure we're going to make it
Sure we're going to make it, we're going to make it


Now if you want a role model
Of a life most blissfully led
Then look no further than Pumbaa here
Than this laid-back quadruped


Relaxation's the name of the game
Be cool and be thick-skinned
Let my lifestyle be your reference frame

As long as you stand upwind



Your guide must be
This rhapsody



I gets up when I like


He's got it all worked out!


I plan the day ahead


He's got it all worked out!


When inspiration strikes


He's got it all worked out!
Look up in the sky
There's a speck that's flying by
Red lights and I don't know why
Seems that I spend most of my time
Watching the planes go by

The windows open, the curtains blow
Round my room where the lights are low
I stand in darkness and watch the stars
Wondering just how far you are from me

I'm out here
You're somewhere
Somewhere out there
Too far from me

And I want it to be
Like it was when the summer was here
Instead of just sitting here
Watching the planes go by

The street lamp look lonely
I wonder, I wonder if it feels like me
With no one to love him
And no one to talk to
When she's out there moving
Without thinking 'bout me
Don't you have a word to show what may be done
Have you never heard a way to find the sun
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blue

Have you seen the land living by the breeze
Can you understand a light among the trees
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Tell us all today
IF you know the way to blue

Look though time and find your rhyme
Tell us what you find
We will wait at your gate
Hoping like the blind

Can you now recall all that you have known
Will you never fall when the light has flown
Tell me all that you may know
Show me what you have to show
Won't you come and say
If you know the way to blueWise men say
It looks like rain today
It crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the sleepy subway trains
For heavy eyes could hardly hold us
Aching legs that often told us
It's all worth it
We all fall in love sometimes

The full moon's bright
And starlight filled the evening
We wrote it and I played it
Something happened it's so strange this feeling
Naive notions that were childish
Simple tunes that tried to hide it
But when it comes
We all fall in love sometimes

Did we, didn't we, should we couldn't we
I'm not sure 'cause sometimes we're so blind
Struggling through the day
When even your best friend says
Don't you find
We all fall in love sometimes

And only passing time
Could kill the boredom we acquired
Running with the losers for a while
But our empty sky was filled with laughter
Just before the flood
Painting worried faces with a smile
Wise men say
Looks like rain today
Crackled on the speakers
And trickled down the steepy subway trains
Heavy eyes could hardly hold us

Painting worried faces with a smile
I'm weary and I'm staying up late
And the rain hits my roof so hard
You know I'm no longer thirty
These days I'm happy to play
One or two hands of cards
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around

And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back


Humidity hangs like a curtain
Oh, it fogs up my glasses sometimes
You know I've still got my eyesight
These days I'm happy to see
A sunset instead of a line




There's a long list of names
That i don't recall
Even though my memory's good
The rain washed away
The lemons and weeds
When the weight of the world weighed more than it should
I hate flies in the kitchen buzzing
Disturbing the peace I've found
Fortune and fame is so fleeting
These days I'm happy to say
I'm amazed that I'm still around
And the weight of the world is off my back
When we fell, we got up
And crawled out the cracks
Excuse me if I take some comfort in that
Happy today, happy to play
With the weight of the world off of my back

What more could one expect of something new 
A feast of saints and sinners
A home-spun web of bold beginnings
This new world boasts a most collective stew

And so indeed I'll plunge into the stream
Here, no regret no longer lingers
New passions here I'll cling to
In America, I'll reconstruct my dreams
The German and the Irish flock here with hope and family
And melody of language fills the streets
Like myself, ther  are the French, who bring th ir old-world common sense
While the Spanish bring their fine nobility

Hear the tribal garb and manners of the free people of color
Seems strange to me when others are enslaved
This New Orleans, this melting pot
Is overflowing with cast-offs
Who've been dragged or freely came across the waves


And here there's cheer in the streets
As they shout out the windows
Welcome to the New World!
Of the Cajun and the Creole

Welcome to the New World
The preening puffed-up Europeans
Shake loose your pious shackles
For some good old superstition


Welcome to the New World
Welcome to the New World!

It's hard to feel what's in your head
Where the gas lamps grow
And the garbage blows
Around the paper stands
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight

Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway


It flowed upon the cobbled floor
For the bottle's dead
And they're drunk again
By the tavern door
And a baby cried
And I saw a light
And I wondered where
And I wondered why
There'd be a loss of life
Down here tonight


Down on Western Ford Gateway
That's a place where the dead say
That a man lives no more
That his fair share of days
Down on Western Ford Gateway
Whatever gets you through the night
It's alright, it's alright
It's your money or your life
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a sword to cut through flowers
Oh no, oh no


Whatever gets you through your life
It's alright, it's alright
Do it wrong or do it right
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a watch to waste your time
Oh no, oh no

Hold me darlin', come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin' come on listen to me, come on listen to me
Come on listen, listen


Whatever gets you to the light
It's alright, it's alright
Out the blue or out of sight
It's alright, it's alright
Don't need a gun to blow your mind
Oh no, oh no


Hold me darlin' come on listen to me
I won't do you no harm
Trust me darlin' come on listen to me, come on listen to me
Come on listen, listen
She may be lost
She may be out of bounds
All her tenderness and charms could be something
A man like me has never found
But in her woman's way
She's still a little girl
The things that she wants, the things that she needs
Oh well the choice is hers


Because you can't take a woman
When she doesn't want you
And you can't be a man
If you're blind to reason
Man might be strong
But true love is stronger
You gotta play it straight
When a woman doesn't want you

Her voice invites
Her eyes say more than words
But her needs and complications
Can tear away the memory of last night's girl
And if you're weak
Yeah we're all weak sometime
The best things can wait
The best times they come
Oh when strength is kind




And if you can't read her
Leave her alone
And if you don't know by now
She's not someone's prize
And you can't take her home

I lived in a tenement six floors above
I lent you my records and I lent you my love
But you left me on the weekend without a by-your-leave
That's a dirty and a low-down trick
My folks all think you're mean

But I don't mind, that's kind of nifty
You always see those break-ups in the movies
And just like a light honey you put me out
Now I'm gonna do my best
To get you back in the nest you came from
You can erase me if you want to
Turn your back in other men
But whenever you're ready
Honey, we'll go steady again

It's nasty without you in my little room
I miss you like crazy, please come back soon
I was joking with those things I said
I couldn't have been thinking
If you don't come back I think I'll crack
Just like my old ceiling
Holding all the pictures that my life's drawn
I never find I'm missing love

Remembering all parades that had been rained on
But never cloudy leaving love



Ask me what it is that makes it special
Why it's so real to me 


It's knowing who keeps their place in my heart
It's knowing how is it I can feel you
It's knowing never will I change my mind
When I think about love, I think about you
When I think about love, I think about you


Too many times I've turned my emotions on and off

Without realizing what it does

Know what's moved me and kept me going this far

But I never questioned what it was
I'm very low but not too dim
I can still see the faces of you and him
I remember well how it used to be
You remember too obviously

Remember when, remember when I was Tealby Abbey then
It was not so long ago maybe a hundred years or so
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago
When I was Tealby Abbey
That's a long long time ago
When the clock stopped and the rocks dropped
And the gravel started giving away
I can still recall when we were small
But oh what a fateful day

In younger times, children climb
Up and down your walls
And a curse on the day the fates will sayNone
They say we bruise too easily
I don't know if it's that way for me
I've seen them come, I've seen them go
I've seen everyone I know
Fall in and out of love
It's just the way it goes
Word is out, silence seems so loud
There's no light above or below me now
I've seen it grow, I've seen it live
I've seen everything I give
Falling out my hands, no matter who I'm with


Nobody ever tells you
When love is dying, when love is dying
It just gets a little colder
And we stop trying, we stop trying, yeah we stop trying
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh when love is dying


There's a pain you never can explain
It cuts so deep time and time again
I felt it then, I feel it now
But nobody told me how
To fight a world of hurt
Somebody help me now
Hold my hand girl much tighter, much much tighter
'Cause what I've got to say I only hope and pray
Comes out as well as I rehearsed it yesterday

And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go
And baby when the first tear shows
It's a sign for you to go and leave her alone
With the broken dreams that she owns

It's a crime for me to tell you
It's a sin for me to stay
And I'll never look behind me
When I start to walk away
Firl I'm sorry but it's all that I can say
You know that I used to love you so
Enjoy every moment together
Well I'm not the kind of man
To forever hold your handNone
You tore my heart in pieces
Now I'm fighting all these demons
All this pain is hurting
Seeing your shadows I'm hallucinating
Reminiscing on the times we had
And now I just want it to last


Anyways I was fading away
Couldn't see from a distance that far
But it's clear now
You were meant to be
Whenever you are next to me
All I want to do
Is to wake up next to you
I got no idea where I'm going
So show me the way
Making deals with the devil
Like fighting your means
Stop hiding your feels 


You tore my heart in pieces
Now I'm fighting all these demons
All this pain is hurting
Seeing your shadows I'm hallucinating
Reminiscing on the times we had
And now I just want it to last
See the changes here on every street
As time goes marching to a different beat
Moving on into the restless age
As the kids today find their feet

Young enough to chase our dreams
We were captured by romantic things
Touched by love until it made us cry
How our hearts could fly without wings


Oh won't somebody tell me
Tell me where have all the good times gone
Say that you remember
Remember all those good old Four Tops songs
Won't somebody tell me
Where have all the good times gone


Stolen moments in the smoky room
Monday mornings that would come too soon
Crazy summers that would never end
When the time was spent loving you

Some things never seem to last
Ain't it funny how we missed the past
Love has changed but the clock still turns
While the flame still burns for you
NoneDada dum-da dadada dum-da
Where it's at

Where it's at

He's a man who knows most everything
Of anything at all
Tells a story of psychology
And his story never falls
He's a man who wears a portobello yellow bill-bob hat
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at
He's a man who draws illusions
And he carves them on a tree
Including all the love he found
He gives to you and me
And I don't even know his name
But I surely promise that
He's a man who knows exactly where it's at

Roaming around from place to place
He takes in all that he sees
He notices the good things that please him
He watches all the bad things that grieve him
But he loves everybody and he knows just where it's at

He was born of Gypsy parenthood
And he's always lived the land
And if people who would talk to him
Just cannot understand
But no matter what they say of him
They'll always tell you thatNone
Shoorah, shoorah


She grows, she's grown like pampas
Tall in the wind
She's simple and spiteful
She's all girl, woman and mother
She's had my children and she's been my lover


No no no no, no no, she don't like to fight it
Once you've been bitten
You get excited
Ma-ma-ma-ma-mama, she really likes her
She comes for coffee, and my mama asked me


So where's the shoorah, she sang
You know I hear it again, my friend
Where's the shoorah, she came upon it
Waiting to sing her back
'Cause she likes to sing about
Where's the shoorah, she sang
Over and over and over
Where's the shoorah, she sang
I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing
Half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep

Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed

So where to now St. Peter
If it's true I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now St. Peter
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report

I took myself a blue canoe
And I floated like a leaf
Dazzling, dancing half enchanted
In my Merlin sleep
Crazy was the feeling
Restless were my eyes
Insane, they took the paddles
My arms they paralyzed


So where to now, St. Peter 
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter 
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on

It took a sweet young foreign gun
This lazy life is short
Something for nothing always ending
With a bad report
Dirty was the daybreak
Sudden was the change
In such a silent place as this
Beyond the rifle range


So where to now, St. Peter 
If it's true, I'm in your hands
I may not be a Christian
But I've done all one man can
I understand I'm on the road
Where all that was is gone
So where to now, St. Peter 
Show me which road I'm on
Which road I'm on


I took myself a blue canoe
You're cruel, you do
You do, you do me wrong
You hurt me, you flirt with
Any old face that comes along


But I won't be your whipping boy
No I won't be your whipping boy
Break me like a little toy
Run me till my feet are sore
But I won't be your whipping boy


You're wild, you're sly
What you done to me
I was thirty, I look like fifty
But I feel like sixty three




It's this illegal kind of loving
That keeps my motor running
From the start to the finish line
It's a trashy kind of me that likes to believe
That I'm still trying, I'm still trying
I'm still trying, yes I'm trying
You're dirty, but you're worth it
But you're way, you're way too young
I could do time if they found out
Look out, San Quentin here I come

Look at me twice with wildcat eyes
Promise me everything except a blue night
Shudder like ice in cut crystal glass
Melt in embraces of crazy-eyed past


And whisper, whisper, whispering whispers


Tantamount to a lie with lingering breath
Walking fingers run, hungry scratches left
Dull chimes ringing like an empty voice
A distant smile framed, her lips are soft and moist

With whispers, whispers, whispering whispers


And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone


With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers




With your whispers, whispers, whispering whispers


And whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
With your whispers, whispers, whispering
Whisper in a rhythm your lies
Keep comfort for others
Hurt me with the night
Whisper like cold winds close to the bone
Save heaven for lovers, leave me alone
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten
And children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Dust settles on a thin cloud
Sends a fog drifting to a worn out crowd
I've had my face in a mirror for twenty four hours
Staring at a line of white powder
High-priced madness pays the tab
I've scraped too much of nothing from your plastic bag
I'm a catatonic son of a bitch who's had
A touch too much of white powder


And she's a habit I can't handle
For a reason I can't say
I'm in love with a wild white lady
She's as sweet as the stories say


White powder, white lady
You're one and the same
Come on down to my house won't you
And hit this boy again


White powder

White lady

You're one and the same
Come on down to my house, won't you 
And hit this boy again
White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
You're in the way

White man danger
Time on his side
Red man, you don't know it
But your world just died

Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no pain
Let's hear it for the white man
He feels no shame
White man danger
His day has come
Red man got two chances
Slim chance and none

White man danger
He's come to stay
Red man, it's all over
Tonight it's hot down here
I can almost smell the rain
And I can almost taste the fear
Behind your name
Fans turning on the ceiling
I feel sticky as a chili dog
White boys howling in the evening
On that hollow log


Tall tales down the river
Say we aim to bury the truth
But the right hand just delivered
The devil in a suit
And he talks big in Whitewash County
Talks sweet as sugar cane
Got a past that's filled with lightning
Got a future filled with rain


Bug buzzing in an empty glass
Fiddle scratching some lazy tune
We're just some place that history passed
New dust, new broom
And it's a high hot buttered moon
He's got a shiny new wax face
Swears the South's gonna rise again soon
All over the place
Come on over, baby
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Yes, I said come on over, baby
Baby, you can't go wrong
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

Well, I said come on over, baby
We got chicken in the barn
Woo, I said come on over, baby
Really got the bull by the horn
We ain't fakin'
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on

I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
I said shake, baby, shake
Come on over
Whole lotta shakin' goin' on
Oh, let's go






There's a light on in your window
There's a shadow on the street
Two silhouettes tell me it's over
The shadow knows that shadow's me
I won't crawl, I caused you trouble
Well, that's the last thing I'll ever do
But before I leave your life completely
Tell me, who wears these shoes, darling


Lord knows the days just get longer
The nights grow cold with you on my mind
And I feel like an old jukebox
Playing the same song all the time
If these crazy dreams don't kill me
It's more than I can take from you
Not knowing where or when I'll see you
Not knowing, darling, who wears these shoes

My friends all say don't go to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I wanna know who's in my footsteps
I wanna know who wears these shoes
My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I wanna know who's in my footsteps
I wanna know who wears these shoes, darling


Oh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do
When I face the two of you
Oh, and it's a chilling feeling
When I can't see him
What do I do 
What do I do 


My friends all say don't go to pieces
I say that's fine but if I lose
I wanna know who's in my footsteps
I wanna know who wears these shoes
My friends all think I must be crazy
I see the facts but if it's true
I wanna know who's in my footsteps
I wanna know who wears these shoes, darling
Darling

It's written clear, across the room
In silent words the blind could understand
I came here to relax and find
A sleep that soaks me up
Like surf and sand
And you appear as I descend
A soft outline all poised and a feather light
I come into the darkness now
To conjure up a dream
And close my eyes

And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream


Don't send me back to real life
The daily grind just leaves me feeling numb
Leave me in my wicked dream
Where pressure cracks and beauty
Comes undone


And don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked dream


So don't disturb me if you dare
And join me if you have the nerve
I'll show you where the best of me has been
Behind my eyes I'll wait for you
Imagine just what we could do
Come join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked
Come and join me in my wicked dreamThe more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you

The more I want the more I steal
The more I hold the less is real
All worldly things I follow blind
In hope not faith was paid in kind
The line is drawn, the change is made
I come to you, I'm not afraid

And I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love you
I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you, I love you without question, I love youThe more I learn, the more I see
The less the world impassions me
The hungry heart, the roving eye
Have come to rest, do not apply
The frantic chase, the crazy ride
The thrill has gone, I step aside

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
I love you
I love you
Without question, I love you

I'd believe in anything were it not for you
Showing me by just existing only this is true
Oh, I love you
I love you
Without question, I love you
Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
A radio humming in every car
And it feel like the clocks have stopped
Calypso moon just cast its spell
We grabbed that magic just because
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was


Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'll say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was

Loose clothes and a cool, cool drink
A greasy breeze from the chicken stand
Heart's on fire just one last time
A wishbone snapping in every hand


Some things you don't forget
Some things just take a hold
A wonderful crazy night like that
Takes you back won't let you go
Some day if you ask him all about the key to love
I'd say that wonderful night
What a wonderful crazy night it was


We found the place to feel it
We knew where we were at
Started the path, felt out our future
Don't everybody need a night like that


Ice cubes on the back of your neck
Warm wind blowing through the parking lot
We remember and never forget
What a wonderful crazy night that was

1, 2, 3 - ooh yea
Ooh oh-oh...
I hope you don t mind, I hope you don t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

Hey TIP, lemme holla at ya...
Making yo momma proud, looking in yo daughter s eyes
Kickin' it with your sons, trippin', never realize
How good you got it, been so wrapped up in yo losses
You couldn t see the profits, could still be in the projects
Instead releasing projects just poppin when niggas floppin
So you went back to prison, TIP  It could've been a coffin
Now since we talkin', you been trippin' ever since I died
Appreciate you missin' me but G, you still alive
I m lookin' down at you, and sendin' smiles to you
I checked the wedding out, oh tell Tamika hi would you 
Told you she would get you, that s good cuz shawty ride with you
Kids getting big, seen King riding a bicycle
See Niq Niq drive a car, see Bubba big as you
I see Domani rappin, and he s spittin too
Little Deyjah beautiful, and Major supercool
My life is over with dawg, your life is good to you


And you can tell everybody, this is your song
And you can tell everybody, this is your song
I hope you don t mind, I hope you don t mind
That I put down in words... how won-der-ful life is

I remember it like it was yesterday
Snow in the park and skaters on the ice
Long black cars standing side-by-side
Loading up the boys at night
Turned up our collars to the chill of the wind
Caught an innocent smile from a taxi at the lights
Not something you'd see on a New York street
It's such an uncommon sight


But I wouldn't have it any other way
This city's got a thing about it, don't try to understand it
New York city I'd really like to stay
New York city I wouldn't have you
I wouldn't have you any other way

Oh the subway rumbled underneath
Italian lights where joey gallo died
And the man on the door down at 54's
Letting only the pretty inside
I'd wake with a stranger under the covers
Late in the day and longing for the night
Just like the snowfall there's so many bodies
But somehow it feels so right




And I can feel the magic
And read a million lips
And no matter what might happen
They'll never sink this ship


There are ladies, illegal X's
Mona Lisa's, well connected
They may be shady, English roses
Blue blooded, turned up noses
Money talks, see what it catches
Postage paid, no strings attached
She's a honey, she's a tramp
Roaring twenties, molls and vamps


Wrap her up, I'll take her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up, I only get one chance
Beasts and beauties, but they all can dance
Wrap her up, I'll taker her home with me
Wrap her up, she is all I need
Wrap her up
Give her to me, wrap her up

Is she foreign, legs eleven
Italian girls, take me to heaven
You pretty babies, from Paris, France
Crazy horses, love to dance

I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus
Feel more like the Wall of China
Getting old as Methuselah
Feel tall as the Eiffel Tower
I'm not a power of attorney
But I can rock as good as Gibraltar
Ain't no more no spring chicken
Been plucked but I'm still kicking

Poison penmen sneak, have no nerve to speak
Make up lies then they leak them out
Behind a pseudonym, the rottenness in them
Reaching out trying to touch me


Met some Oscars and Tonys
I slipped on a pavement oyster
Met a snake climbing ladders
Got out of the line of fire



Brainless writers gossip nonsenses
To others heads as dense as they is
It's the same old malady
What they see is faulty
I'm not the wreck of the Hesperus
Feel more like Big Bill Broonzy
Getting old as my mother
But I tell you I got some company


Is there anything left 
Maybe steak and eggs
Waking up to washing up
Making up your bed
Lazy days
My razor blade
Could use a better edge
It's enough to make you laugh
Relax in a nice cool bath
Inspiration for navigation
Of our new found craft
I know you
And you know me
It's always half and half


And we were, oh, oh, so, you know
Not the kind to dawdle
Will the things we wrote today
Sound as good tomorrow 
We will still be writing
In approaching years
Stifling yawns on Sundays
As the weekends disappear

I am here to tell you we can never meet again
Simple, really, isn't it  A word or two, and then
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell
The someone you once loved so long ago so well


Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by
You don't have to ask me, and I need not reply
Every moment of my life from now until I die
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand

Is it written in the stars
Are we paying for some crime
Is that all that we are good for
Just a stretch of mortal time
Is this God's experiment
In which we have no say
In which we're given paradise
But only for a day


Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned
What it is to be in love and have that love returned

Nothing can be altered, there is nothing to decide
No escape, no change of heart, no anyplace to hide


You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied

So long, boy you can take my place
I've got my papers, I've got my pay
So pack my bags and I'll be on my way
To Yellow River
Put my gun down, the war is won
Fill my glass high, the time has come
I'm going back to the place that I love
Yellow River


Yellow River
Yellow River is in my mind and in my eyes
Yellow River
Yellow River is in my blood, it's the place I love


Got no time for explanations
Got no time to lose
Tomorrow night you'll find me sleeping underneath the moon
At Yellow River


Cannon fire lingers in my mind
I'm so glad that I'm still alive
And I've been gone for such a long time
From Yellow River
I remember the nights were cool
I can still see the water pool
And I remember the girl that I knew
From Yellow River

Yesterday when I was young
The taste of life was sweet as rain upon my tongue
I teased at life as if it were a foolish game
The way the evening breeze may tease a candle flame
The thousand dreams I dreamed, the splendid things I planned
I always built, alas, on weak and shifting sand
I lived by night and shunned the naked light of day
And only now I see how the years ran away


Yesterday, when I was young
So many drinking songs were waiting to be sung
So many wayward pleasures lay in store for me
And so much pain my dazzled eyes refused to see
I ran so fast that time and youth at last ran out
I never stopped to think what life was all about
And every conversation I can now recall
Concerned itself with me, me and nothing else at all

Yesterday the moon was blue
And every crazy day brought something new to do
I used my magic age as if it were a wand
And never saw the waste and emptiness beyond
The game of love I played with arrogance and pride
And every flame I lit too quickly, quickly died
The friends I made all seemed somehow to drift away
And only I am left on stage to end the play


There are so many songs in me that won't be sung
I feel the bitter taste of tears upon my tongue
The time has come for me to pay for yesterday
When I was young
When I was young
Un poderoso rey ser 
Sin oposici n
Pues yo nunca he visto un rey le n
Que no tenga mech n
Nunca ha habido nadie as 
Ser  la sensaci n
Observa como rujo yo
 Te causo un gran temor!
Pues no parece nada excepcional
Yo quisiera ya ser un rey
Tiene un largo camino por recorrer mi se or si cree que

Nadie que me diga
Bueno, cuando dije que...
Lo que debo hacer
Quise decir que...
Nadie que me diga
C mo debo ser
 Pero mire aqu !
Libre de correr ser 
Bueno, definitivamente eso no
Todo lo que quiera har 


Usted y yo tenemos que de cara a cara hablar
Mira nada m s al rey quien quiere aconsejar
Si este es el rumbo que llevamos yo no voy
Lejos yo me voy de  frica no me voy a quedar
El chico cada d a est  mas mal, Simba
Yo quisiera ya ser un rey




Miren por aqu 
Miren por ac 
Donde me vean, Ser  una estrella 
Y con cada criatura compartir
Que fuerte por doquier se pueda o r
Lo que el rey Simba tiene que decir
Yo quisiera ya ser un rey
 l quisiera ya ser un rey
Yo quisiera ya 
 Ser un rey!
I can feel the time closing in
I can feel the years crawling through my skin
And if I doubt myself I can count on the rain
To cover the tears of this ageing game
But I can count on you to play your part
I don't miss a beat of your animal heart
And when you push from behind I know I can
Cover a mountain with the palm of my hand


And oh, babe, you can make history young again
You could rewrite, you could decide
The things that should or shouldn't have been
You could look at me in the scheme of things
Oh, oh, babe, you could make history young again


I can watch the weeks sweeping by
I can recollect the hearts hanging out to dry
When the world shuts down I can touch my fears
I can hear lost youth ringing in my ears
But I lost nothing when I gained you
You just blew me away with yesterday's news
When you run your fingers down my spine
It's like throwing a switch on the hands of time
You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You can stop the world, steal the face from the moon
You can beat the clock, but before high noon
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

You've got one life with a reason
You need two hearts on one side
When you stand alone and there's no one there
To share the way it feels inside and baby

You can cheat the devil and slice a piece of the sun
Burn up the highway but before you run
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone

When you're gonna play with fire
You let someone share the heat
When you're on your own and there's no one there
To cool the flames beneath your feet and baby

You can win the fight, you can grab a piece of the sky
You can break the rules but before you try
You gotta love someone
You gotta love someone
I said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

I've always done the best that I could
To make you happy like I should
If only you knew what I've heard about you
You'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go
I could have been mistreated if I'd been bad
But people tell me I'm the best that you've had
So there's something I want you to know
I think you'll be sorry to see me go
You'll be sorry to see me go

You said from the start that you'd be mine
But now it just seems I'm just wasting your time
If only you knew the hurt I've been through
You'll be sorry to see me go
So you're just thinking of me
Just like I know you should
I can not give you everything, you know I wish I could
I m so high at the moment
I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
We still got love to give


While we re young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke, high school kids

We have so much in common
We argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, but...
I'm pretty sure I'm right
What's fun about commitment 
When we have our life to live
Yeah, we're just young dumb and broke
But we still got love to give


While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Yadadadadadadada
Yadadadadadada
Yadadadadadadada
Young, dumb, broke high school kids


Jump and we think - do it all in the game of love
Love
Run into sin, do it all in the name of fun
Fun
Whoa-oa-oa
I'm so high at the moment
I m so caught up in this
Yeah, we re just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give
Young, gifted and black
Oh, what a lovely precious dream
To be young, gifted and black
Open your heart to what I mean

In the whole world you know
There's a million boys and girls
Who are young, gifted and black
And that's a fact

Young, gifted and black
We must begin to tell our young
There's a world waiting for you
This is a quest that's just begun

When you feel really low
Yeah, there's a great truth you should know
When you're young, gifted and black
Your soul's intact

Young, gifted and black
How I long to know the truth
There are times when I look back
And I am haunted by my youth 

Oh but my joy of today
Is that we can all be proud to say 
To be young, gifted and black
Is where it's atYou put something better
Inside of me
You put something better
Inside of me

I could look out the windows
Or stare at the wall
But really it didn't matter
No I just didn't care at all

Could be sitting by the water
I've a constant ache in the morning light
It's on account of the night before
Some Park Lane lady in a shady bar
Took a fancy to the watch I wore


Oh, but I can still remember how she laughed at me
As I spun around and hit the bed
She said, "Thank you honey, forget about the money
This pretty watch'll do instead"


City living woman, you're so static
Matching your men with a hook and an eye
If you're gonna spend the summer in New York City
Oh, them women, oh oh oh, they're gonna slice your pie
Said you're so static, baby I've had it
Rolling in a yellow cab
Downtown hustlers trying to pull some muscle
Oh, if they catch you, oh oh oh, it could turn out bad


It's "Show me what you want, I'll show you what I've got
I can show you a real good time"
She's a friend indeed of a friend in need
But you'll be sorry when she leaves you crying
None


I could really get off being in your shoes
I used to be stone sold on rhythm and blues
I heard of a place at the back of town
Where you really kick the shit when the sun goes down
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight, I learned for certain that the blues expired


Oh, your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Out-bucks the broncos in the rodeo-do
She's only sixteen, but it's plain to see
She can pull the wool over little old me
Your sister can't twist, but she can rock and roll
Your sister can't twist, but she got more soul than me


Somebody help me 'cause the bug bit me
Now I'm in heaven with the aching feet
But I'll be back tonight where the music plays
And your sister rocks all my blues away
I really got buzzed when your sister said
"Throw away them records 'cause the blues is dead
Let me take you, honey, where the scene's on fire"
And tonight, I learned for certain that the blues expired
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind that I put down in words
How wonderful life is while you're in the world
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of thes well they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on

This feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money, but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
If I was a sculptor, heh
But then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a traveling show
I know it's not much, but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
And you can tell everybody

It may be quite simple, but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind

How wonderful life is while you're in the world

And say man what are you doin' here 
Oh, la, la-la, di-di-da

It was a lovely day at dinner, and Belle is a winner
And there is something to begrudge about the test
Soup D Jour had some hot orders, and there are no disorders and the men have provided all the rest
There s a plot to bring disaster
Lumiere: Let s talk about it Master
Beast: We got to get our heads in the game
Cogsworth: If we don t have any teamwork and waste our time
Beast: That would be a shame
Lumiere, we gotta get help from the objects
Lumiere: We got a whole lot of teamwork to be solved, and a lot of information to involve
Beast: The basketball and theater thing every day now
Cogsworth: We had a lot of dinners to prepare, that is something that I cannot bear
Beast: The west wing is forbidden, like I said, don t go there
We have a plot to bring disaster
Maestro: we gotta fix this master
Beast: We think that Mrs. Potts is to blame
Lumiere: If she is then she'll announce it to the world
Beast: Oh my, that would be a shame
Lumiere: Yeah, that would be a shame
Cogsworth: Oh my god, that would be a shame
Lumiere, Cogsworth, Beast: A shame
Beast: Lumiere, we need more information
Lumiere: about what 
Beast: The East wing

But no matter what happen you know that
