
Well, we're here
We're at the common again
Smoked six of the ten fags that I only bought an hour ago
Said, "Well I, I like the look of your shoes
I like the way that your face looks when I'm arguing with you"
And so when, when we all grow old
I hope this song will remind you I'm not half as bad as what you've been told
And when I knock at a hundred and two
And I see your pyjamas
I can't stop smiling at you

That's why we're here, we're at the common again
I've been pouring my heart out towards your optimistic grin
I said, 'Well I, I like the cut of your jib
I like the way that your face looks when you're yapping on about him"
But on this shirt I found your smell
I just sat there for ages contemplating what to do with myself


I called you up at a hundred and two
We just sat there for ages
Talking about that boy what was getting on to youNoneNoneNone
I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do while we try to recall how we met


Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten
About you 

You and I 
We're alive 
With nothing to do, I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait 
And pretend 
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end 


Do you think I hav  forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I hav  forgotten
About you 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten
About you 


And there was something about you that now I can't remember
It's the same damn thing that made my heart surrender
And I'll miss you on a train, I'll miss you in the mornin'
I never know what to think about
I think about you
About you

I know a place
It's somewhere I go when I need to remember your face
We get married in our heads
Something to do while we try to recall how we met


Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten
About you 


You and I 
We're alive 
With nothing to do I could lay and just look in your eyes
Wait 
And pretend 
Hold on and hope that we'll find our way back in the end


Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten
About you 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten 
Do you think I have forgotten
About you 
Welcome, welcome boys and girls into a more distracted world   comprised of all the things you knew but older now   the things inside post   'don't you mind' reflect upon a recent time   where you and I were both online and part of a collective mind And still are we online you see but with much more consultancy   In groups we search ironically to find our self identity, embracing femininity, skeptics of affinity   maybe neither actually   deleting all civility   and fearing most proximity   but that has happened 'obviously' if you look retrospectively   but that's my point   that hindsight there   it's captured our collective stare a constant daze at bygone days seduced by programmed time delays   inside our phones our need has grown for inside there we're not alone   you see it's not all doom and gloom, just sanctify outside your room   it's easy when you're made aware, a more authentic captured stare   and something else to celebrate the fact that we can stay up late and share and care and make aware, some stranger who is over there   and change and mould and right some wrongs whilst streaming all our favourite songs   the left and right grow more apart but you can just click 'add to cart'.
Are we awake 
Am I too old to be this stoned 
Was it your breasts from the start 
They played a part
For goodness sake
I wasn't told you'd be this cold
Now it's my time to depart
And I just had a change of heart
I'll quote "On the Road" like a twat
And wind my way out of the city
Finding a girl who is equally pretty won't be hard
Oh, I just had a change of heart
You smashed a glass into pieces
And that's around the time I left
And you were coming across as clever
Then you lit the wrong end of your cigarette
You said I'm full of diseases
Your eyes were full of regret
And then you took a picture of your salad
And put it on the Internet
None
I was about to say this. Good evening, The O2

London. London, we played here last night. Tonight, tonight was the first show that sold out

I loved last night. I loved it with all of my heart, it was one of the best parts of the night. But this is hard core

I want to feel as close as possible because this is fucking massive

Alright, let's just sing songs together

"A Change of Heart."



Are we awake

None
I get out my records
When you go away
When people are talking
I miss what they say


'Cause it all means nothing, my dear
If I can't be holdin' you near
So tell me you love me
'Cause that's all that I need to hear


I sit in my kitchen 
With nothing to eat
With so many friends I
I don't wanna meet


'Cause I don't need music in my ears
I don't need the crowds and the cheers
Oh, just tell me you love me
'Cause that's all that I need to hear


I've been told so many times before
But hearin' it from you means much more
So much more

I get out my records

In jeans so new
"We should eat one before 2"
Man, I'm so high
I think I love you
And I was thinking 'bout leaving again
It all depends, are we just friends 
And can you leave a little bit of your K 
For you, babe, it's anobrain
We take your mum's car to the edge of the town
And we drive, yeah, we go 'round and 'round
And I swear there's a ghost on this island
And his hands, all covered in blood
And my wife inquired of understanding
But of course, my dear, you can't
She said, "How can I relate to somebody who doesn't speak 
I feel like I'm just treading water"
Is it the same for you 
Is it the same for you 

Well he comes and he goes, so capricious
And his work appears so rushed
Well I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much
Is it the same for you 
Is it the same for you 
Is it the same for you 
Is it the same for you 
Well the criminals and liars
Keep them in your cells as a privilege of mine
And I love the house that we live in
And I love you all too much
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
The blood is on your tongue as well as your hands
Archaic and content you just wash them off

NoneNoneIn a zen-like state
I turn my car around in your drive
You've got a great apartment
It's such a shame we can't go inside


And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And she said, "All the drinks are all on me"
And all and all and all and all and all
And all and all
Come back to my apartment
And don't be afraid of the ghosts
Tonight, baby girl, we'll have a party
And they'll just be invisible hosts
For you



Grab your shoes
And your bag
And grab your coat

And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
And then
Well, she just flew back home
And then she just flew back home
Then she just flew back home
In a zen like state
I turn my car around in your drive
You've got a great apartment
It's such a shame we can't go inside
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all


Come back to my apartment
And don't be afraid of the ghost
Tonight baby girl we'll have a party
And they'll just be invisible hosts for you


And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And she said;
"All the drinks are all on me"
And all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all, and all

This feeling, it's something when you call me
I'm dealing in death and being lonely
Try it, don't like it
And leaving you here is the thing that I fear, so I fight it
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 

I'm reeling, I know that I'm appalling
But this feeling, it could be our calling
Not dying, no, just lying
Seeing you here is the moment it's clear 'cause I'm crying


Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
Do you wanna leave at the same time 
And be my mistake
Then turn out the light
She bought me those jeans
The ones you like
I don't want to hug
I just want to sleep
The smell of your hair
Reminds me of her feet
So, don't wait outside my hotel room
Just wait till I give you a sign
'Cause I get lonesome sometimes
Save all the jokes you're going to make
Whilst I see how much drink I can take
Then be my mistake


I shouldn't have called
'Cause we shouldn't speak
You do make me hard
But she makes me weak

You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that
You think I'd leave you down
When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me
Oh when you're cold
I'll be there
Hold you tight to me
When you're on the outside baby
And you can't get in
I will show you
You're so much better than you know
When you're lost and you're alone
And you can't get back again
I will find you
Darling and I will bring you home
And if you want to cry
I am here to dry your eyes
And in no time, you'll be fine


You think I'd leave your side baby
You know me better than that

When you're down on your knees
I wouldn't do that
I'll tell you you're right when you're wrong
And if only you could see into me


Courageous words, sire, but where you're going, that won't be possible
No matter how long it takes, Julien, I will stop you!)


Now listen to me and put your head into my hands
I'm here to save the world because I'm a magic man


And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from outer space
With that sad look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And Laura told you we were going out
And I always said I mean you well
Watch you, you were the one I swear
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent on him
Just give me a chance now to turn it around

Now here's the time of day
I've been around the block
Well I m aware of the guy you insist who s smoking pot


And I went through years of dreaming just to avoid you
But now you're back from your grandma's place
With that pissed look upon your face
Just like the one you had when you came back
And found Bon Jovi had broken up
But I always said I mean you well
You're always living on a prayer
When I came back home to find the hotel rooms and the phone bills
You spent with him
Chin up, chest out and turn it around






And if I search, I'll find you
Darling!


Well, I'm back
Can I see you 
I'm back

You say, we go where nobody knows
Got guns hidden under our petticoats
No we're never gonna quit it
No we're never gonna quit it, no
Now we run, run away from the boys in the blue
And my car smells like chocolate
Hey now think about what to do

Pause it, play it, pause it play it, pause it

Oh we go where nobody knows
With guns hidden under our petticoats

Go get it, go get it
Got get it, go get it, go!

And all I need is some chocolate to save my life
Rest in peace 'Pac, I know in death you're still alive

Please give me my hat 'cause I'm 'bout to wander over yonder
Hittas know I'm givin' the antidote like T Scott
Boy you better know, who better know, who make the scene pop
They can't stop me, I'm going hard non-stop
You better not cry, every waterfall's a teardrop
'Cause I'm gonna be acquitted for the crimes that I've committed
Step to me, I just forbid it
Don't permit it, don't forgive it
'Cause we never gonna quit it
That's my life, I'm gonna live it
That's my cap, it lookin' fitted
And my flow just counterfeited
I've been dealing with the pressure
Chillin' with the freshers
Drive just like a thresher
I just want this shit forever
In My Feeling's my endevour
Whenever ever I'm never gonna sever, yea

When you're in love, but you don't know what to do with it
When blackness hangs overhead like a cloud


Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, the sun will shine through


When you wake up and you don't know what day it is
When the pain flows through your heart and your bones

Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, the sun will shine through


When you feel no one knows just what you're going through
When your insides feel much colder than snow


Don't worry, darling, 'cause I'm here with you
Don't worry, darling, oh, don't worry, darling
Don't worry, darling, I'll always love you

Used to spend cheese up on steez, yeah I remember
Used to take trips whippin' the Jeep my mom loaned us
Ridin' real slow
Mmhm, that the shit they didn't know
Cruisin' down 59 seeing niggas ridin' fours I just stared at the stars
Look with my eyes closed cause it's driving me wild
Hit the weed and just drive

Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive
While I'm staring in your, staring in your
Sometimes I drive, sometimes I drive

I think it was the codeine
But she thinks it's just trees
I like it when you stroke me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
She likes to take LSD
Searching mathematical purity
Travel with security
Smokin' in the wind
Losing all my friends, smokin' in the wind
She said I'm feeling so lean, I think you called it codeine
Now her heads on their knees
I like it when you blow me
Eighteen, eighteen bitch
Bitch,  don't smoke all my weed
Bitch, don't smoke all my weed
Broken heads in hospital beds
Saving ends and pulling your friends
While you're chasing the first line
We made it through
He's black and blue
And facedown
She's rushing in your bed
You take draws to sort your head
And facedown
Then he said, "I lost my head, can you see it "
What time you coming out 
We started losing light
I'll never make it right
If you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need's my bike and your enormous house
You said someday we might
When I'm closer to your height
'Til then, we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need

Don't you see me  I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And don't you need me  I
I think I'm falling, I'm falling for you
And on this night, and in this light
I think I'm falling , I'm falling for you
And maybe you, change your mind
I think I'm falling, I think I'm falling
I'm caught on your coat again
You said, "Oh no, it's fine"
I read between the lines and touched your leg again 
I'll take it one day at a time
Soon you will be mine, oh
But I want you now 
When the smoke is in your eyes
You look so alive
Do you fancy sitting down with me  
'Cause you're all I need
According to your heart
My place is not deliberate
Feeling of your arms
I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

What time you coming out

I don't wanna be your friend
I wanna kiss your neck

Come here, come here, come here, come here, come he... come here

*kisses Chris*

I like Chris, though. I like Chris. He's my  friend. He's my friend

*sigh* Now, *shush*. Everyone shush. Fuck me, I'm gonna sit down. Can you all see...  I know some of you can't see me. How are you feeling  You feeling good 

Good. I am.... I feel like.. th-this obviously for me, for us, is incredibly special. I mean, there's a lot, there's a lot of people here. And... it blows our mind. And I think the... there's an element of me that wants to really, I dunno, preserve the purity of why we're here, 'cause you're all.... here for the..., you're all here to see our band. So you're all here for same reason, which is fucking cool. Loads of people in the same place for the same reason. And, umm.... And, I just think it's important that we're all here together for a little bit
I'm gonna stand up so you can see me so you can understand that I'm sincere when I say this

It's just that I feel.... And I don't say this a lot on tour, because I'm... I'm always on tour, we're always on tour. And I feel like I live my life like a fucking forum, like.... like I'm "Hey, I don't know that you feel that" and everything you do is subject to discussion and debate and you validate your experiences by documenting them and I'm just as bad as anybody as soon as I see anything that I find... beautiful or interesting or good. I just think, "Right, I need to.... get my fucking phone out and take a picture of that." So I really, I empathize on that feeling like, "You. Go there, now." I know what it's like

I don't... ohh, I didn't mean to shout you out at your little face. I'm so sorry

*chuckles* I.. but, but what I'm saying is that I do that as well, right  But let's just, for five minutes, look.... if we can get every person in here just to be a fucking person for five minutes.....

And that's not me being grumpy. I'm just saying, trust me, right  The memory, the visceral memory of the next three-and-a-half minutes will be better than a video on your iPhone

And if you want to film it, that's fine, but you're missing out

And let's play, "fallingforyou."

I need some more wine


What time you coming out 
We started losing light
I'll never make it right if you don't want me 'round
I'm so excited for the night
All we need is my bike and your enormeous house
You said some day we might
When I'm closer to your height, till then we'll knock around and see
If you're all I need
None


Go outside 
Seems unlikely
I'm sorry that I missed your call 
I watched it ring 
"Don't waste their time"
I've always got a 


"Oh, boy, don't cry"
I'm sorry, but I
I always get this way sometimes 
Oh, I'll just leave
I'll save you time
I'm sorry 'bout my 





"Stay at mine
You might just like it
Might stop you being miserable" 
Nah, I'm alright
Nah, trust I'm fine
Just dealing with a 

You there
You always seem to get what you want
You, you always seem to get better
And I'm dreaming, you're bleeding, depleted
And I'm bouncing off the floor of your ceiling
This feeling, gets demeaning
You know, you know, you seem to get better
And I still lie outside

Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
So go and take a little bit if you want
If you want to go and take a little bit if you want to
You're bleeding, depleted, gets demeaning
You know, you know you seem to get better
I, I am the prince of the Tyne
Guess you wouldn't know cause you sleep on your side
An' I guess you wouldn't know, I guess you wouldn't know
You seem to get better


Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
Well this car moves faster than I'm ever gonna find you 
*DISCLAIMER: This song was written by the band currently known as The 1975 when they went by the name BIGSLEEP. I'm publishing the lyrics here so that we don't have to make a million separate artist pages for the previous names The 1975 has taken on over the years. Thanks :)

You, you always seem to get what you want

Bite your face to spite your nose
Seventeen and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where's the fun in doing what you're told 


I said, "No"
"Oh, give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned eighteen year old
Give me a night, I'll make you"
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age
But, girl, I'm not your saviour"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now


'Cause they're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's seventeen
They're just girls
They're just girls
A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around 

London!


Bite your face to spite your nose


What's that 

17 and a half years old
Worrying about my brother finding out
Where s the fun in doing what you're told 

I said "No!"
'Oh give it a rest, I could persuade you
I'm not your typical, stoned 18 year old
Give me a night I'll make you'
"I know you're looking for salvation in the secular age, but girl I'm not your savior"
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because


They're just girls breaking hearts
Eyes bright, uptight, just girls
But she can't be what you need if she's 17
They're just girls
They're just girls


A pair of frozen hands to hold
Oh, she's so southern so she feels the cold
One moment I was tearing off your blouse
Now you're living in my house
What happened to just messing around 


I said "Yo, I think you better go, I can't take you
You just sit and get stoned with 30-year-olds and you think you've made it"
'Well, shouldn't you be fucking with somebody your age instead of making changes '
Wrestle to the ground
God help me now because

You learn a couple things when you get to my age
Like friends don't lie and it all tastes the same in the dark
When your vinyl and your coffee collection is a sign of the times
You're getting spiritually enlightened at 29


So just give yourself a try
Won't you give yourself a try 
Won't you give yourself a try 
Won't you give 
I found a grey hair in one of my zoots
Like context in a modern debate, I just took it out
The only apparatus required for happiness is your pain and fucking going outside
And getting STDs at 27 really isn't the vibe
Jane took her own life at 16
She was a kid who had the box tattooed on her arm
And I was 25 and afraid to go outside
A millennial that baby-boomers like
Won't you give yourself a try 
Won't you give yourself a try 
Won't you give yourself a try 
Won't you give 

Ladies and Gentlemen
Please give it up for the greatest band on the planet
The 1975
Goodnight

Where is your boy tonight 
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town


When I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
The hope I forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you 


You need him
I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him


Where is your boy tonight 
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town


Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
The meantime, I'll sport my brand new fashion
Of waking up with pants on
At four in the afternoon

I was missing the guys 
In my rented apartment
You would think I'd have realised
But I didn't for quite sometime
Started wetting my eyes 
'Cause I'm soft in that department
Right then I realised
You're the love of my life


The moment that you took my hand
Was the best thing that ever happened, yeah
The moment that we started a band
Was the best thing that ever happened
And I wish that we could do it again
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened to me
It was the best thing that ever happened


I took a zoot outside
In my coat's secret compartment
I hear a song and start to cry
Pretend it's smoke that's in my eye
I don't know why I'm surprised
'Cause we all shared one apartment
Man, they were the golden times
They were the best of my life

Confidence is comical
And I'm, and I'm happy
That's what I like
I'm happiest when I'm doing something that I know is good
That's happiness for me
I'm happiest when I'm doing something that I know is good
That's happiness for me


She showed me what love is
I'm actin' like I know myself
Oh, in case you didn't notice
Oh, oh, I would go blind just to see you
I'd go too far just to have you near
In my soul, I've got this feeling I
Didn't know until I seen ya

She's insatiable, is what she is


Her body's like a modern art
Take it out in front of me
I've gotta stop messin' it up because
I'm feelin' like I'm messin' it up
Because I'm callin' out your name and God help me
'Cause oh, I'm never gonna love again, hey
I'm never gonna love again, hey, oh


Show me your love
Why don't you grow up and see

Show me your love
Why don't you 
Oh 

I'm sorry that your dad is dead
I hope you amend it
I think I've lost a lot of my friends
Through belief that I'm an instrument
Well fuck me if you must then
Treat me like an old friend
I can't exist within my own head
So I insist on haunting your bed
If you could only hear what I said
You'd see

I'm not scared 
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
Spin car 'round, push your head down, down, down
And smash into the ground with you
There's been a piece of glass found and a terrible sound, sound
What if what they're saying is true 
Oh, I prefer it in your bed; television set
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scared
I'm not scaredNone
Keep your voice down
And stop looking at my friends
Blow out
They can hear exactly what you say

Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing 

Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Can we go now 
Not staying 'til the end
Fall down
Write another song about your friends
Lock me in, knock me out
Talking like you do
And if you think you're helping me
I don't think I'm helping you
Drink, fall, spew
Telephone you
If you're alone in your room
What's that boy doing 
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Head, cars, bending
Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat's made for two


'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
Said, "It's nice to have your friends 'round"
We're watching the television with no sound
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out 
It's just you and I tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out 
Push your lack of chest out
Look at my hair
Gotta love the way you love yourself
Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection on your mental health
'Cause I remember when I found you
Much younger than you are now
And once we started having friends 'round
You created a television of your mouth

One! Two! One, two three, go!


Rushing in a small town
I forgot to call you
Running low on know how
This beat I made for two


'Cause I remember that I like you
No matter what I found
She said, "It's nice to have your friends 'round
We're watching the television with no sound"


It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out 
It's just you and I, tonight
Why don't you figure my heart out 


Oh my god, london...


Push your lack of chest out
"Look at my hair!"
Gotta love the way you love yourself
"Your obsession with rocks and brown
And fucking the whole town is a reflection of your mental health"


Hello, it's been agesInterview with Bang Tidy MusicInterviewer: New track "HNSCC" from Music For Cars is a far cry from what you ve done before, especially the fact it features no lyrics. What was the idea behind the track 

Matty Healy: My Nana who I was close to died of cancer this year and it was around about that time that the guitarist s mum got diagnosed with cancer and it felt like it was a big impact, the fact that something you have no control over can really mess with the dynamics of people s lives. It s actually a live guitar take. I was playing the guitar plugged in the computer and George was putting it through every plugin you can imagine. He recorded it without telling me so I was in the zone. This was 2am on a Saturday night so we were under the influence. I recorded the guitar take and we listened to it back hammered and we were like  this is really pretty man, nah let s get some sleep . We woke up the next day and we just spent like half an hour putting little moments of vocals and synth and that was that. I think Music for Cars is the most honest record in regards to things like thatNoneI've not learned

Take something and then make it brand new
Try and do anything fourteen times
Love yourself like someone you love, one you love
Don't take any of my advice 
Write a letter to your future self who won't change
Don't let the internet ruin your time
They can take anything as long as it's true
What they can't take is you telling them lies, lies, lies, lies
I scrolled online
And saw your damn post
It's full of lies
And it's really shitty
You post on reddit
And I'll correct it


I swear that I

I lasted more than five mins
Why did you say five mins
It was more than five mins
Huge if true, just five mins
Think we need to rewind
Your sense of time is fucked up
It was more than five mins
Didn't mean to disappoint, disappoint ya


She said that I
I didn't last but
I told them I
Definitely lasted longer
Than she's saying
Would be huge if true
Def huge if true

Considerin' me looking through you
Thinkin' it was somethin' I used to do
I thought I'd done anger
I thought I'd done shame
But I've always been the same


Don't you know that I'm a human too 
You know that you're a human too 
And darlin', that's what humans do
So, tell me you're a human

I'm sorry about the bomb thing
That's overdue
I'm sorry that I quite liked seein' myself on the news
And I'm sorry that I'm someone that I wish I could change
But I've always been the same
Yeah, I've always been the same


Don't you know that I'm a human too 
You know that you're a human too 
Darlin', that's what humans do
So, tell me you're a human


Don't you know that I'm a human too 
You know that you're a human too 
Darlin', that's what humans do
So, tell me you're a human
And don't you know that I'm a human too 
Should know that you're human too
Oh darlin', that's what humans do
So t ll me you're human
Oh, tell m  you're human
And tell me you're human
I bet you thought your life would change
But you're sat on a train again
Your memories are sceneries for things you said
But never really meant
You build it to a high to say goodbye
Because you're not the same as them
But your death it won't happen to you
It happens to your family and your friends

So I lay in what you've made
My opinions changed
But my outlook stays the same

Focus if you want to be
Anyone you wanna be
The only problem is you say
You look just like Penelope
And I can't find a reason to do
Exactly what you wanna do
So I'll just pretend
That we're still friends

At the best of times I'm lonely in my mind
But I can find something to show you
If you have got the time
Why would I rely on the things that I did right 
She said, "I gave you four years of my life"
So, what about these feelings I've got 
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
What about these feelings I've got 
I couldn't be more in love
I could have been a great line
I could have been a sign
Or overstay my time
Say what's on your mind
Maybe I'll rely on all the things that made it right
Because I'd give you all the years of my life


So, what about these feelings I've got 
We got it wrong and you said you'd had enough
But what about these feelings I've got 
I couldn't be more in love

I ve got a God-shaped hole that s infected
And I m petrified of being alone now
It's pathetic, I know
And I tossed and I turn in my bed
It's just like I Lostmyhead 
And if I believe You
Will that make it stop 
If I told You I need You
Is that what You want 
And I'm broken and bleeding
And begging for help
And I'm asking You Jesus, show Yourself
I thought I d met You once or twice
But that was just because the dabs were nice and opening up my mind
Showing me consciousness is primary in the universe
And I had a revelation
I'll be Your child if You insist
I mean if it was You that made my body
You probably shouldn't have made me atheist
But, oh, I m a lesbian kiss
I'm an evangelist
And if you don't want to go to hell then Miss, you better start selling this

I see her online
All the time
I'm trying not to stare down there
While she talks about her tough time
Girl of your dreams
You know what I mean
There's something 'bout her stare that makes you nervous
And you say things that you don't mean
Well, I found a hotel, I called up the twins
It's seven in the morning, so they won't let me in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen

"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know"


I've been wearing nothing every time I call you
And I'm starting to feel weird about it
Sometimes, it's better if you think about
This time, I think I'm gonna drink through it
Then I see her online, and I don't think that I should be calling
All the time, I just wanted a happy ending
And I pretend that I don't care about her stare
While she's giving me a tough time
Well, I found a motel, it looked like the bins
I think there'd been a murder, so we couldn't get in
I need to get back, I've gotta see the girl on the screen


"Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I'm not playing with you, baby, I think that you should give it a go"
She said, "Maybe I would like you better if you took off your clothes
I wanna see and stop thinking, if you're too shy, then let me
Too shy, then let me know 
Well, if you're too shy, then let me know 
If you're too shy, then let me go" 

All right, now we're cookin'
How you feelin' New York

Heartbeat

Oh, if you don't stop
I'm gonna need a second one
Oh, there's something I've
Been meaning to
Say to you, baby 
Yeah, there's somethin' I've
Been meanin' to
Say to you, baby
But I just can't do it


What a call, movin' in
I feel like I can loosen my lips 
I can summarise it for you
It's simple and it goes like this


I'm in love with you, I- I- I- I- I

I've been watching you walk
I've been learning the way that you talk
The back of your head is at the front of my mind
Soon I'll crack it open just to see what's inside your mind


Inside your mind


Maybe I will wait until you're fast asleep
Dreaming things I have the right to see
Maybe you are dreaming you're in love with me
The only option left is look and see


Inside your mind
Inside your mind


I can show you the photographs of you getting on with life
I've had dreams where there's blood on you
All those dreams where you're my wife


Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
Inside your mind
The skin that you're in is all soft now
And your bones are dry as ice
What you sitting 'round here for, and why you sad 
'Cause everybody's pushing out babies now
In the mornings, I was getting high with you
In the mornings, I was getting high with you
'Cause everybody's pushing

'Cause everybody is pushing
'Cause everybody is pushing

Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now, dead now, dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Well I thought I'd see you around but you're dead now
Oh, I preferred it before
We should ring Dad more
Lost our house
Hold me close
I stopped by, just to wash my clothes
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can watch you 
I know it's me that's supposed to love you
And when I'm home, you know I got you
Is there somebody who can love you 
Love, you
Is there somebody who can watch you 
Is there somebody who can watch you 
I think there's something you should know
I don't feel like myself, I'm not gonna lie 
How would you know  It doesn't show
I think there's something you should know 
I think there's something you should know
I m feeling like someone, like somebody else
I don t feel myself, it could be my health
I'd like to meet myself and swap clothes
I think there's something you should know









You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright
You get a moment when you feel alright


I feel so seen and I can't dream
Sleeping terrifies me, otherwise, I'm fine
See-saw back and forth, back on the door, back on the floor
Oh, please ignore me, I'm just feeling sorry for myself
Feeling like someone, like somebody else, who don t feel themself
Paying for their wealth with their mental health
I'd like to meet myself and swap clothes
I think there's someplace I should go
I think there's something you should know
None
Danny ran into some complications
He falls asleep during conversations
He's gotta search the street when he's on vacation
The worst thing is that I'm in the same situation
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
And Danny says we're living in a simulation
But he works in a petrol station 
He says it all began with his operation
And I know you think you're sly but you need some imagination
And all I do is sit and think about you
If I knew what you'd do
Collapse my veins, wearing beautiful shoes
It's not living if it's not with you
All I do is sit and drink without you
If I choose then I lose
Distract my brain from the terrible news
It's not living if it's not with you

We just keep getting better, baby
Let's go New York!

Got a 20-stone monkey that I just can't beat
I can stage a situation, but I just can't eat
And there's a feeling, you're replacing embrace

I'm in love with Jesus Christ
He's so nice
I'm in love, I'll say it twice
I'm in love 
I'm in love, but I'm feeling low
For I am just a footprint in the snow
I'm in love with a boy I know
But that's a feeling I can never show

Fortunately, I believe, lucky me
I'm searching for planes in the sea, and that's irony
Soil just needs water to be, and a seed
So if we turn into a tree, can I be the leaves 


Ooh
Ooh


I'm in love with the girl next door
Her name's Claire
Nice when she comes 'round to call
Then masturbate the second she's not there

Yes focus all your rage
Along before I push you

You're always delighted

NoneSummerSlam, aside from consistently being one of the most watched WWE pay-per-views every year, may also be used to describe the onslaught of new music coming from the indie rock and pop world this season. Everyone from Lana Del Rey to MGMT has a new record slated for a summer release, and while other music sites may feel inundated, Rock Genius in fact thrives off of new tunes. This week, we are happy to give you a little insight into the latest tracks from artists spanning the genres of alternative rock, pop, and psychedelic rock. Need we say more 

-- Squanto

5.  The 1975 - "Chocolate""Now we run run away from the boys in the blue/
And my car smells like chocolate/ "The 1975 vocalist Matthew Healy details the pot-fueled sexcapades of himself and his lover, as they flee from the cops in "Chocolate." Within the context of this song,  Chocolate  refers to weed . Listeners may either feel waves of nostalgia or the urge to rebel   la Healy , as he and his lover continue with their nefarious joy ride, in typical Bonnie and Clyde fashion.

4. Franz Ferdinand - "Right Action""Come home, practically all is nearly forgiven/
Right thoughts, right words, right action/
Almost everything could be forgotten/ "In the opening lines of "Right Action", vocalist Alex Kapranos is probably comparing the unconditional love in his romantic life to the unconditional love and forgiveness preached by Christians. This imagery might serve to put his lover on a pedestal, displaying her as a sort of almost all-forgiving Christ figure. However the use of  hedging  terms like practically and nearly give the impression that not everything in Kapranos s life is peachy. Nothing a little make-up sex can't fix right 
3. MGMT - "Your Life is a Lie""Here's the view, over the rocks/
Your life is a lie/
Don't say a word, I'll tell you why/
Keep living the lie/"Wake up, work your 9-5 job, go home, watch your TV shows, then go to bed. This, unfortunately, is the daily routine of most Americans. MGMT laments this, stating that this brand of droning conformity simply results in people waiting to die, not really living their life to the fullest. As you probably guessed, MGMT couldn t care less about a nice view and financial security. The far-out psych rockers are more concerned with astral projections and higher powers.

2. Lana Del Rey - "Beautiful Player""You make me coo coo like a turtle dove/
So hot that I can't get enough, enough of you/
Hit me and it felt like a kiss/
You know it hurt so good, when you do me like this/"Pop's favorite submissive finds herself in a peculiar situation, yet again. Lana finds her man so appealing that any form of physical contact with him is pleasurable to her, even if he strikes her. This sadism is placed against a Los Angeles backdrop and pairs well with ecstasy pills and champagne. It is also fairly reminiscent of Britney's golden days, a fact with which we absolutely have no issue.

1. Pixies - "Bagboy""Like when I hear the sound of the feet slapping on the runway/
Like a small bird pretty while it's crapping on the new day/
Cover your breath, polish your speech/"Although this summer we saw founding Pixies member Kim Deal depart from the legendary alt-rock group, the band seems to not be slowing down whatsoever. Frontman Francis Black details his affection for a perfectly imperfect girl in "Bagboy," praising her clumsiness, bad breath, and her ability to shit on your day if she feels like it. A new take on the typical love song, Black seems to be less concerned with flawlessness than he is with grimy primitivism, as can be seen in his potent..imagery.
Watch out cause he s coming for you
Watch him as he finds us upon your roof
Well I came back home to find out
I d not had sex with you


Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on
Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on

We ve wasted too much time out here
So tell my friends that I just had an accident
Go on, just tell my friends
That I just had to go


Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on and on
Yes now that you re here
This song will go..


I can t hear you
I can t hear you
I can t hear you
What did you say 
I can t hear you
I can t hear you
I can t hear you
What did you say 


Fuck that, I m sick of waiting on you
I dropped you off just as soon as I got my phone back
And I can t hear you
I can t hear you
I can t hear you
Just what did you say 
What did you say before 

Watch out he s coming for you
Watch him as he finds us on your roof
Well I came back home to find out I d not had sex with you


Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on


We ve wasted too much time again
So tell my friends that I just had an accident
Go on just tell my friends
That I just had to go


Because now that you re here
This song will go on and on and on and on
On and on and on and on and on
Yes now that you re here
This song will go
A picture of a cat
Or something worse
A racist attack
A foreign nurse

A family pet
A brand new purse
A man of steel
A wooden hearse

It's not fun
It should've been
Let it run
Hold it in
Something borrowed
Something new
Something old
Me and you

A Gemini
A well lit path
A sexy girl
Another bath

Being sick
Being kissed
The taste of cum
And loads of crisps
Somebody runnin' through the field
Somebody shoulda stayed home
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody they were gettin' to know
Somebody lackin' in desire
The type you just don't fuck
A supreme gentleman with a gun in his hand lo-lo-lo-lookin' for somebody to love


Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love

I wanna show him he's a bitch
I wanna fuck him up good
I wanna smash the competition, go and kill it like a man should
"You gotta show me how to push if you don't want a shove"
Are the words of a young man already damned, lo-lo-lo-looking for somebody to love


Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for som body to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should hav  seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should have seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love


Somebody lyin' on the field
Somebody cryin' on the phone
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody  they were gettin' to know
Maybe we're lackin' in desire
Maybe it's just all fucked
But the boy with the plan and a gun in his hand was lo-lo-lo-lookin' for somebody to love 

Somebody runnin' through the field
Somebody shoulda stayed home
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody they were gettin' to know
Somebody lackin' in desire
The type you just don't fuck
A supreme gentleman with a gun in his hand lo-lo-lo-lookin' for somebody to love



Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love

I wanna show him he's a bitch

Are the words of a young man already damned, but he was looking for somebody to love


Lookin' for somebody to love
Lookin' for somebody to love
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should have seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love 
Oh they ran, oh they ran
You should have seen how they ran when I was lookin' for somebody to love
You should have seen it man, I was all bang, bang, bang, bang
Lookin' for somebody to love


Somebody lyin' on the field
Somebody cryin' on the phone
Somebody pickin' up the body of somebody they were gettin' to know
Maybe we're lackin' in desire
Maybe it's just all fucked
But the boy with the plan and a gun in his hand, well he was lookin' for somebody to love

We're fucking in a car, shooting heroin
Saying controversial things just for the hell of it
Selling melanin and then suffocate the black men
Start with misdemeanours and we'll make a business out of them
And we can find out the information
Access all the applications
That are hardening positions based on miscommunication
Oh, fuck your feelings
Truth is only hearsay
We're just left to decay
Modernity has failed us
And I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
Yes, I'd love it if we made it
And poison me, daddy
I got the Jones right through my bones
Write it on a piece of stone
A beach of drowning three-year olds
Rest in peace Lil Peep
The poetry is in the streets
Jesus save us
Modernity has failed us

You got a beautiful face, but got nothing to say 
"You look famous, let's be friends
And portray we possess something important
And do the things we'd like"
"We've just come to represent
A decline in the standards of what we accept!"
Yeah, yeah, yeah  No
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh 
And love me 
If that's what you wanna do, oh

You're making me and breaking me
I tried to be like you
And knocked down she wants you to
And I
When you fall asleep tonight
Because you dream of me

That's why I'm not asleep right now; I  can barely open my eyes
Now the telephone rang when you weren't getting any answer
You said you know she slept with him
Fuck the rain I'll walk back home

I can't find you

You might just dream of me

Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be...
My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything
I need but it needs to keep selling me
Besides celebrities lacking in integrity
Holding up the status quo instead of showing the kids
That they matter, who are they gonna batter next 
Just keep holding their necks and keep selling them sex
It s better if we keep them perplexed
It's better if we make them want the opposite sex
Disenfranchised young criminal minds in a car park beside where your nan resides are not slow, they ve just never been shown that you should be 
...loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Oh, oh...
We're all human, we're just like you, man
We re sentient or something or other I can t remember, whatever
We shouldn't have people afloat
If it was safer on the ground, we wouldn't be on a boat
Charlatan telepathy exploiting insecurity and praying on the purity
Of grief and its simplicity  but I know that maybe I'm too skeptical
Even Guy Debord needed spectacles, you see
I'm the Greek economy of cashing intellectual cheques
And I'm trying to progress, but instead of selling sex...
And I think I should be...

I'm not here to talk about politics, we're not here to think about politics. We're here for a release, we're here for some music, a release from all the bullshit
*Someone shouts "fuck Donald Trump*
Ah, but that's the thing, it's not even really about fuck Donald Trump, that's the thing. It's not even that..

We've been in America for like, three months during the election and we were in the UK during Brexit so we fucking picked our time in this year. But that's not, that's kind of not the rhetoric that's needed cause I was so angry and I know, look at- We see loads of young, liberal, compassionate people every night so this is like our world, this is the world that we see. So when things go at odds of that, it's really confusing and it's really fucking- It makes you really angry and the thing is, I know it's very sad to see all of these young voices of progression and change being drowned out by regressive ideals and bullshit. It's very sad. And it appears to be paradigms of race and it is about that, and it is about gender, and it is about age, and it is about sexuality, but it's also about a lot of these people that voted against for what we stand for

They feel so so disenfranchised by both sides of political systems that that felt like the right thing to do. So if we're young, right  And we're liberal, and we're compassionate, and we're Muslim and we're black, and we're gay, and we're whatever. If we are that then it's our responsibility to be compassionate, to listen to everybody, listen to their concerns and move things forward. And you are our people and we love you so fucking much, you have no idea. This song's about loving someone..


You should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be loving someone
Oh, oh, loving someone
Yeah, you should be..


My heart is telling me the telly isn't telling me anything

I got a plane in the middle of the night, don't you mind 
I nearly killed somebody, don't you mind, don't you mind 
I gave you something you can never give back, don't you mind 
You've seen my face like a heart attack, don't you mind, don't you mind 
I was late, but I arrived
I'm sorry, but I'd rather be getting high than watching my family die
Exaggerate and you and I
Oh, I think I did something terrible to your body, don't you mind 
I put your mother through hell, don't you mind 
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind 
Oh, I was thinking about killing myself, don't you mind 
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind 
I put your mother through hell, don't you mind 
I hurt your brother as well, don't you mind, don't you mind 
Oh, I was thinking about killing myself, don't you mind 
I love you, don't you mind, don't you mind 
I find it hard to say bye-bye
Even in the state of you and I
And how can I refuse 
Yeah you rid me of the blues
Ever since you came into my life


Because you're my medicine

Yeah, you're my medicine



I, I wanna marry you
Said, "I, I adore you"
And that's all I have to say, "bye-bye"
And you opiate this hazy head of mine
Because you're my medicine

Yeah, you're my medicine



Because you're my medicine

Yeah, you're my medicine

Yeah, you're my medicine
I find it hard to say bye-bye

Said I, I adore you

Yeah, you're a medicine

Yeah, you're a medicine
Yeah, you're a medicine, oh


Well I only brought three, what you lookin' at me for 
She's dressed in white and putting off crying
Well you're the best man, so what's the plan 
Why don't you talk to Matty about it 
Said, "I only brought three like I told you before
We're gonna have to ask about"
Free bar, that's the point
Spilling Amaretto 'cause of previous joints
I'm sitting with a girl, fortunate placing
Preceding railing racket off a porcelain basin
And who's he, giving it the lips 
I've never seen him knockin' about
He looks just like me, but 6 foot 3
So I reckon you could knock him out
Well, I think I'll say a couple of words if you don't mind
I never really got on with your bird the first time
I met her out, dressed in nowt
Telling everybody you were shagging about
Well, who's this, going for the kiss 
I'm probably gonna yosh in your mouth
Because it's five past three, I can hardly see
And I'm on the verge of passing out
I can't remember when we met
Because she didn't have a top on 
I improvised a little bit
She said my references were spot on 
"Can I take you for a drink "
She said, "Oh God, I'll have to think
Because we're mates, it doesn't feel right" 
And I said, "It's cool," and "I was messing," but it's true
Yeah, it's you, you're the one that makes me feel right


I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life


I had a dream where we had kids
You would cook, I'd do the nappies 
We went to Winter Wonderland
And it was shit, but we were happy 
I'm sorry that I'm kinda queer
It's not as weird as it appears
It's 'cause my body doesn't stop me 
Oh, it's okay, lots of people think I'm gay
But we're friends, so it's cool, why would it not be  

Ah, we love you guys 


I can't remember when we met
Because she didn't have a top on 
I improvised a little bit
She said my references were spot on 
"Can I take you for a drink "
She said, "Oh God, I'll have to think
Because we're mates, it doesn't feel right" 
And I said, "It's cool," and "I was messing," but it's true
Yeah, it's you, you're the one that makes me feel right


I'v  been in love with her for ages

I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life

I've been in love with her for ages
And I can't seem to get it right
I fell in love with her in stages
My whole life 


And there's been no way for me to say
That I felt a certain way
In stages, oh
I think the story needs more pages 

Straight lines, they unwind you
She does a little thing with her eyes that says, "We're off soon"
She says the bleeding's incidental 'cause she's so cool
She said, "I'm no fun if I've only a bottle of wine"
And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Slow down, yeah, I want you
She does a little bit on the sly that shows what she's up to
She started talking about missing him, she was glistening
It won't mend your heart if it's only a couple of lines

And now she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Straight lines, they unwind you

Yeah, she's doing it all the time
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, do it!


London, this truly is remarkable for all of us, thank you so much for coming

You feeling alright 

How you feeling on the top 

How're you dong  Now, let's go
There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know that you are mine
I fight crime online sometimes
Then write rhymes I hide behind
And my switch, her wine, both crying
I'm fine if you are fine


Looking back on 2009
When people said that it was raining all the time
I see sunshine 'cause I know that you are mine


When you say that I'm wasting your time
Then I smile and tell you things will be fine
For some reason, I just can't say "I do"


There comes a time in a young man's life
He should settle down and find himself a wife
But I'm just fine 'cause I know you are mine
Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend 
Leave  No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend 


It's going off 'cause they're not gonna let him in
Two and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in

Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend 
Leave  No, he's to and fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend 
A broken half a glass has opened up his chin
He thinks he's hard, a powdered mouth that tastes of gin
He's just been barred for that blues he was smoking
And then he barks, "It's my car I'm sleeping in"
Tabs with unlimited O's
New clothes, bloody nose
Powders and walking back home
Has he got enough weed  No
Broken phone, retching on the floor alone
And I can't believe that we're talking 'bout him

Aight, let's take it back




Ok, we're going now, we're going now, we're going back

How are you feeling on this side  How are you feeling on this side 

Everybody, let's play it here, one, two....


Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend 
Leave  No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend 


It's going off 'cos they're not gonna let him in
2 and a half, the boy is rushing out his skin
He's got his charm with the girls that are smoking
He takes her arm, jumps the bar and now he's in


Drink slow to feed the nose, you know he likes to get blown
Has he got enough money to spend 
Leave  No, he's to and 'fro, he doesn't like it when the girls go
Has he got enough money to spend

Imagine if you just did
I'd fill you in on the things you missed
Oh, sleepless Knights, a grown up man dressed in white
Who I thought might just save your life
But he couldn't, so you died
I don't like it, now you're dead
It's not the same when I scratch my own head
I haven't got the nails for it
And I know that God doesn't exist
And all the palaver surrounding it
But I like to think you hear me sometimes
So I reached for a borrowed fleece
From my dad or from Denise
Always trying to keep warm, when you're the sun
I sat with you beside your bed and cried
For things that I wish I'd said
You still had your nails red
And if I live past 72, I hope I'm half as cool as you
I got my pen and thought that I'd write
A melody and line for you tonight
I think that's how I make things feel alright



Take a picture of all my flaws or
You can take a video on your phone
And you know that I would talk
But I'm too afraid to pick you up and go home
I'm feeling Dazed like a magazine
Finding my insanity
Wishing it'll all go away
Now we're smoking up the balcony
You telling me profanities
 Maybe it was never okay 

345's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist for doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "Not again"
Now I gotta tell her that I love one of her friends
345's where we stayed
She told me I'm a narcissist for doing it again
Took a bunch of acid and she told me, "Not again"
Now I gotta tell her that I love one of her friends


And I've been seeing somebody
But I've not found a way to tell you
That I'm seeing somebody
There's not a nice way for me to say that
I've been seeing somebody
You know I want you to be happy
So start seeing somebody
And then maybe we can get on with it


Stayin' late, I just wanna get stoned
Telling all your friends that I'm never at home
And my face filling up with blood
But you're still the same living like a bourgeois
Coughing up the promethazine
Living like an evergreen
Sorry for the things that I've done
Now Selena won't be friends with me
I was kissing Emily
I love you, it was never your fault

And no-one here in New York
Can do me like you do
Fill my bed with roses
We're smashing up the room
I flew out here for diamonds
And all I got was broke
But the only thing worth chasing, is you


And when the lights go down on Broadway
And the taxi's hard to find
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, well no-one seems to mind
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called, I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm alone

Strangers on the subway
Will make you go insane
You smile in their direction
They look the other way
Girls in my hotel room
Say my accent's kinda cute
But no-one here in New York, is you


And when the lights go down on Broadway
And the music starts to fade
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, as strangers look away
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm


Alone somewhere I don't like, eatin' stuff off motorbikes
Calling in a day, I'm calling you
And sometimes doing fisticuffs reminds me of the two of us


And when the lights go down on Broadway
And a taxi's hard to find
I'm cryin' on the Brooklyn Bridge, well no-one seems to mind
I'm sure that you've moved on by now and I shouldn't have called, I know
But no-one here in New York seems to care that I'm alone
Life feels like a lie, I need something to be true
Is there anybody out there 
Life feels like there's something missing, maybe it's you
Is there anybody out there 
I never fucked in a car, I was lying
I do it on my bed, lying down, not trying
Apathy for me is an issue, you see
I just talk about the things upsetting me
And I get somewhere, I don't like it
Get somewhere, change my mind, eh
Get somewhere but don't find it
I don't find what I'm looking for


Yes, and if they catch you slippin'
Trippin' over your fibbing and elicit
A ribbing over how they think you should be livin'
That's life, kind of, maybe take some time off
You can't live in denial of setting it right
Because if nothing is revealed, everything denied
Learn up yourself before you talk it
They need to see you walk it
You don't fuck with your poor fans
You need the rich ones to expand your floor plans
None
I've been suicidal
You've been gone for weeks
If I'm undecided, will you decide for me 
Baby, I'll do anythin' that you wanna
I'll try anythin' that you wanna
I'll try
'Cause you're on my mind


Oh-oh, Caroline
I wanna get it right this time
'Cause you're always on my mind
Oh-oh, Caroline 

Getting suicidal 
It's honestly not for me
I'm gettin' on my nerves by gettin' on my knees
Getting cucked, I don't need it
The place I want to be
Is somewhere in your heart
Somewhere guaranteed


'Cause baby, I'll do anything that you wanna
I'll try anything that you wanna
I'll find myself in the moonlight
'Cause baby, I want everything that you wanna
And I've tri d to just be me like a thousand tim s
But you're on my mind


Oh-oh, Caroline
I wanna get it right this time
'Cause you're always on my mind 
Oh-oh, Caroline 


Oh, I've tried to find
Another name a thousand times
But the only one that rhymes 
Is, "Oh, Caroline!" 
Just give me one more chance tonight
'Cause I don't want to waste my life without you, baby
No, I don't want to waste my life without you, baby

I've been suicidal
You've been gone for weeks
If I'm undecided, will you decide for me 
Just made me happy, I'll do things that you wanna
I'll try anythin' that you wanna
I'll try
'Cause you're on my mind


Oh-oh, Caroline
I wanna get it right this time
'Cause you're always on my mind
Oh-oh, Caroline


Getting suicidal 
It's honestly not for me
I'm gettin' on my nerves by gettin' on my knees
Getting cucked, I don't need it
The place I want to be
Is somewhere in your heart
Somewhere guaranteed


'Cause baby, I'll do anything that you wanna
I'll try anything that you wanna
I'll find myself in the moonlight
'Cause baby, I want everything that you wanna
And I've tried to just be me like a thousand times
But you're on my mind

Looking from a window above
It's like a story of love
Can you hear me 
Came back only yesterday
I'm moving farther away
Want you near me


All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you

Sometimes when I think of her name
When it's only a game
And I need you
Listen to the words that you say
It's getting harder to stay
When I see you


All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you


This is going to take a long time
And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more 
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door
None
She said, "Hello," she was letting me know
We share friends in Soho
She's a pain in the nose
I'm a pain in women's clothes
"And you're a walking overdose in a greatcoat"
And so she wrote a plan for it on the back of a fag packet
She had to leave because she couldn't hack it
Not enough noise and too much racket
"I think I've spent all my money and your friends, oh"

Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
Mr. Serotonin Man, lend me a gram
You call yourself a friend 
I got two left feet and I'm starting to cheat
On my girlfriend again
I caught her picking her nose
As the crowd cheered for an overdose
And I don't suppose you know where this train goes
There was a party that she had to miss
Because her friend kept cutting her wrists
Hyperpoliticized sexual trysts
"Oh, I think my boyfriend's a nihilist"
I said, "Hey kids, we're all just the same
What a shame"
And oh, how I'd love to go to Paris again
And how I'd love to go to Paris again
"Oh, stop being an arsehole and counting my eye rolls"
"They're like piss holes in the snow" - uh oh
Keeping a tab on my health
Man you're putting me up on a shelf
"Well I'll believe you're clean
But only by seeing your face for myself"
And then she pointed at the bag of her dreams
In a well posh magazine
I said "I'm done, babe. I'm out of the scene"
But I was picking up on Bethnal Green
She said I've been romanticizing heroin

This song is, is one of my favourites it's called Paris


She said 'hello' , she was letting me know

Let's do "Paris"!

She was part of the Air Force, I was part of the band
I always used to bust into her hand
In my, my, my imagination
I was living my best life, living with my parents
Way before the paying penance and verbal propellants
And my, my, my cancellations, hm, yeah
And I fell in love with a boy, it was kinda lame
I was Rimbaud and he was Paul Verlaine
In my, my, my imagination
So many cringes and heroin binges
I was coming off the hinges, living on the fringes
Of my, my, my imagination, oh, yeah

Enough about me now
"You gotta talk about the people, baby"



Now I'm home, somewhere I don't like
Eating stuff off of motorbikes
Cumming to her lookalikes
I can't get the language right
Just tell me what's unladylike


I know some Vaccinista tote bag chic baristas
Sitting in east on their communista keisters
Writing about their ejaculations
"I like my men like I like my coffee
Full of soy milk and so sweet, it won't offend anybody"
Whilst staining the pages of The Nation, oh, yeah


A Xanax and a Newport
"Well I take care of my kids", she said
The worst inside of us begets
That feeling on the internet
It's like someone intended it

A diamond in the rough begets
The diamond with a scruff you get

And it started when he was leaning on your car
He said please leave if you re uncomfortable
And he said here s the way it goes
But he cries at dashboard shows
And he s making me uncomfortable
Let's fuck him up and hit the road

If I search I ll find you
Yeah maybe through hide and seek

And that's only if I'm pushing it too far 'cause I couldn t bear to see you uncomfortable

Wake up, wake up, wake up
It's Monday morning and we've only got a thousand of them left
Well, I know it feels pointless and you don't have any money
We're all just gonna try our fucking best
Well, my generation wanna fuck Barack Obama
Living in a sauna with legal marijuana
Well, girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here

People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the, fucking with the
People like people
They want alive people
The young surprise people
Stop fucking with the kids
Wake up, wake up, wake up
We are appalling and we need to stop just watching shit in bed
And I know it sounds boring and we like things that are funny
But we need to get this in our fucking heads
The economy's a goner, republic's a banana, ignore it if you wanna


Fuck it, I'm just gonna get girls, food, gear
I don't like going outside, so bring me everything here
Lyrics from Snippet

My camera loves you
You're its girl most in demand
You be my lipstick outline
I'll be your plastic boyfriend
Will I live and die in a band 
My consciousness controls my hand
She can't swim very well

Let's find something to watch, then watch our phones for half the time
When we go for food, you have yours and I'll have mine
It says, "Don t take these pills if you've been drinking any wine"
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
These things, they have been playing on my mind

I think I've seen the side of every road
They all lead somewhere, I've been told
Will I get divorced when I'm old 

And I met one of your friends, and it was dead nice
He was fine, but he said
"Things that interest me exist outside of space and time"
Now, I know I should've left it, but who says that  What a sigh
It all kicked off and it's been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind


I think it's strange that I still call you
When I ve got nothing to say
The truth is that I still adore you
And nothing really matters anyway
But I won t get clothes online 'cause I get worried about the fit
But that rule don t apply concerning my relationships
See, I keep getting this stuff wrong, take me out, put me on
Oh, these things, they have been playing on my mind
The whole thing has been playing on my mind
Oh, it's all been just playing on my mindNoneNone
You've seen so many faces that I never seen before
I left an unrewarding message telling you to come on
Overdramatic, automatically assume I'll stay the same
There's a change in pressure
We're never gonna lie to you
My broken veins say that if my heart stops beating
We'll bleed the same way

Oh, my broken veins say


Well, I stay tuned and listen to the news

With every step we take, Kyoto to The Bay
We're different and the same, gave you another name

If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
I know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
Cause when I am with you, there's no place I'd rather be


Bring your love, baby, I could bring my shame
Bring the drugs, baby, I could bring my pain
I got my heart right here
I got my scars right here
Bring the cups, baby, I could bring my drank
Bring your body, baby, I could bring my fame
I got my heart right here


Listen, ma, I'll give you all I got
Get me off of this, I need confidence in myself
Listen, ma, give all of it
I need all of it, I need all of it to myself


If you gave me a chance I would take it
It's a shot in the dark but I'll make it
I know with all of your heart, you can't shake me
Cause when I am with youLadies and gentlemen

Well, I touch down and run to my connection
Man in the gift shop called me a fag
I feel like my tucked-up erection
There's a pressure all over my head
And I know this is how I get paid, but
It's not really how I wanna get laid, so
Hundred forty when I last got weighed
And I'm gonna lose more by Saturday


And they're playing your song on the radio station
Mugging me off all across the nation
If you don't eat, then you'll never grow
I should've learnt that quite a while ago
I know it gets hard sometimes
Making out with people that you don't like
I know you don't feel alright
But you look just fine to me


Well, I pissed myself on a Texan intersection
With George spilling things all over his bag
And I took shit for being quiet during the election
And maybe that's fair, but I'm a busy guy
I get stoned and go where I get paid, but
It's not really how babies get made, so
I'll take a minute when I think I won't die from stopping
Oh, I'm just a busy guy

Taking out your shit on the ones you like
You know, I didn't feel alright
Until you spoke to me

Hey!
She had a face straight out a magazine
God only knows, but you'll never leave her
Her balaclava is starting to chafe
And when she gets his gun, he's begging, "Babe, stay, stay, stay, stay, stay"
"I'll give you one more time
We'll give you one more fight
Said one more line
Will I know you "

Now if you never shoot, you'll never know
And if you never eat, you'll never grow

And when she's leaving your home she's begging you to stay, stay, stay, stay, stay

There'll be a riot, 'cause I know you"
Well now that you've got your gun
It's much harder now the police have come
And I'll shoot him if it's what you ask
But if you'd just take off your mask
You'd find out everything's gone wrong
Now everybody's dead
And they're driving past my old school
And he's got his gun, he's got his suit on
She says, "Babe, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool, you look so cool
You look so cool"

The 1975's video analysis for "Robbers" will be delayed, if interested to work on this project contact Damasa.


Scene 1: The Intro Walk

Immediately introducing two new characters, showing a early passionate connection between them. Their style radiates off a persona of a seventies movie, grunge bad boy vibe to it.

Scene 2: Montage of the Next to Come

As the Matty sits on the bed with his girl he reflects back over the things that have happened while getting interrupted by a thought of  the heist, suggesting these future ideas are now in planning.

Scene 3: Swimming Pool
00:00 - 00:00
Reflecting over the time spent well we see the fire in them around their friends growing with this drug induced state; the love flows  however when these highs run out things can start to go down hill.


Scene 4: The House
00:00 - 00:00
Representing the new start of their love, an investment a place where the truth really comes out where they can share both their highs and lows. It becomes interesting as over time we see this initial love slowly fading, but there is still an underlining obsession they have.Scene 6: The BedScene 7: CokeScene 8: CafeScene 9: MoviesScene 10: Warehouse & GunScene 11: TipsyScene 12: Outside the WarehouseScene 13: The HeistScene 14: The VanScene 15: Home SurgeryScene 16: Spoils of richesI took the boat down to the blacksmith's at the breaks
Quite ridiculous 
He said "The problem that we've got living round here's fighting all these scary monsters"
And there's one coming down
Top of the roofs
Get out the car
We're just running
Running away

It's in your house now
It's in your house now now
In your house now now

Well mister, you came straight bolting in looking scared
Quite ridiculous
Said "you never guess what just happened seven just got manipulus"

She said "you don't look frightened at all"
With one so near
You just kept on saying that it's all, it's all gonna get colder
It's gonna get colder now
Now you're here
You can make no sound
And they'll still sense you're near

They can't run as fast as I can
We'll be here soon
You'll be laughing, manI took the boat down to the blacksmith's at the breaks

And they'll still sense you're near

They can't run as fast as I can
We'll be here soon
You'll be laughing, man
A soft sound to the way that she wears her hair down
Covering up her face
And oh, what a letdown
I don't seem to be having any effect now
Falling all over the place
And you're losing your words
We're speaking in bodies
Avoiding me and talking about you
And you're losing your turn
I guess I'll never learn
'Cause I stay another hour or two


For crying out loud, settle down
You know I can't be found with you
We get back to my house
Your hands, my mouth
Now I just stop myself around you
A small town dictating all the people we get around
What a familiar face
Do you get what I mean now 
I'm so fixated on the girl with the soft sound
And hair all over the place

And this is how it starts:
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah, my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said, "Use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common, it's this tongue of mine"
She said, oh
She's got a boyfriend anyway
There's only minutes before I drop you off
All we seem to do is talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I loved your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face, but I like that 'cause he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we're on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no, you say no
Does he take care of you 
Or could I easily fill his shoes 
But you say no, you say no


Now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you, love
If we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
You've got your tongue pierced anyway
You in your high tops any day
You in your skinny jeans anyway
You and your fit friends anyway
I'd take them all out any day
They've all got backcombs anyway
You all got boyfriends anyway
And this is how it starts
You take your shoes off in the back of my van
Yeah, my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said, "Use your hands and my spare time

And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no, you say no
Do s he take care of you 
Or could I  asily fill his shoes 
But you say no, you say no

Let's fucking have it!

Yeah, my shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back

But you say no
You say no
None
And she lays down on her bedroom floor
The chemicals that make her laugh
Don't seem to be working anymore
She tries her best, but it hurts her chest
And even though her sun is gone
She'd like to love her child nevertheless
My hair is brown, she's scared to touch
And she just wants to feel something
And I don't think that's asking for too much
And when I go to sleep it's when she begins to weep


She's appalled by not loving me at all
She wears a frown and dressing gown
When she lays down


We got a plane, oh to see my dad again
She prayed that we'd fall from the sky
Simply to alleviate the pain
Over water, hmm
Over terrain
The engines all go bust, we turned to dust
And I've no reason to complain, yeah
And in the end, she chose cocaine
But it couldn't fix her brain

Big town
Synthetic apparitions of not being lonely
"Look, he's having a breakdown
Oh, what a letdown, a shame, I think he might die"
And now she's dancing enthralling, I guess I gotta wait my turn
I said, "Don't fall in love with the moment"
She said, "I've got a lot to learn"
And you know I'm in love with this city
But the green is turning brown
And I just look pathetic now

If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're so intelligent, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American 
And if she likes it 'cause we just don't eat
And we're socially relevant, she's American
If she says I've got to fix my teeth
Then she's so American 
She's inducing sleep to avoid pain
And I think she's got a gun divinely decreed and custom made
She calls on the phone like the old days, expecting the world
And don't fall in love with the moment
And think you're in love with the girl
There's no more water in this city
But be careful or you'll drown
You think you've got it figured out


If she likes it 'cause we just don't eat

With a face from a movie scene
Or magazine, know what I mean 
She's definitely got the style on you
She's definitely got the style on you

She said "It's not about your body
It's just social implications are brought upon by this party that we're sitting in
And I'd like to say you've changed but you're always the same
I've got a feeling that the marijuana's rotting your brain"

Irony is okay, I suppose
Culture is to blame
You try and mask your pain in the most postmodern way
You lack substance when you say something like, "Oh, what a shame"
It's just a self-referential way that stops you having to be human
I'm assuming you'll balloon when you remove the dirty spoon and start consuming like a human, that's what I am assuming
I'm sure that you're not just another girl
I'm sure that you're gonna say that I was sexist
I feel like you're running out of all the things I liked you for

Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers 
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say
And why would you believe you could control how you're perceived
When at your best you're intermediately versed in your own feelings 
Keep on putting off conceiving
It's only you that you're deceiving
Oh, don't have a child, don't cramp your style, I'll leave it
Why can't we be friends, when we are lovers 
Because it always ends with us hating each other
Instead of calling me out, you should be pulling me in
I've just got one more thing to say
I'm just pissed off because you pied me off
After your show when you let go of my hand
In front of some sket who wanted bit on your
Nah, I m just messing
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright
Yeah, it's the way we are
We were smoking by 11 and knocking 'round town
Beat 'em ups on my arm
We were never good at selling, couldn't cut down
And I stay with my father while his friends die of heart attacks
He's got a heart made of stone, but he never gets cold because the sun's always on his back
"I used to think you were cool, and I believed you had a wonderful vision
But I soon found out you're a terrible friend, and your mother's on the television"
Give's a go on your bike, how you getting along with your life 
It's alright
Yeah, it's alright

Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright
"Well I'm coming to the end of 23," she said, "Is that alright "
"Well, it's coming to the end of you and me," she said, "Is that alright "
And how can you complain about life and talk about being bored 
If you just sit at Pete's house playing video games, doing sniff that you can't afford
I can't be picking up in the town
So get me one off Adam if he's sorting you out
I don't really care what all your friends were about
I was always looking for a way to get out
It's just a reflection on the size of your house
A silver spoon and a zoot in your mouth
But you're alright
Yeah, it's alright
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright, baby
Yeah, so far, it's alright, alright
You've been so good to me
You give me everything
You've been so good to me
Your love

You've been so good to me
Give you everything
And you've been so good to me
Your love

And ohh baby, You're my consolation
And ohh baby, there's no hesitation
And ohh baby, you're my consolation

And ohhhh, you're my consolation
And ohh baby, ohh baby

You've been so good to me
You give me everything
You've been so good to me
Your love
So I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else 

I don't want your body, I don't want your body

And c'mon baby 
You said you'd find someone to take my place 
I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep  Doin' it  and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it
I don't want your body

Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else

So you said, you've found somebody else
And I prayed, that that was just a lie
So I said I loved you one more time
In case that would change your mind
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
Our love has gone cold and it doesn't feel like home when I hold you close
And I'm lookin' at you tryna figure out if this is what you really want"
You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
I guess I don't want your body if you're wishing you were lying here with someone else

So you said, you've found, somebody else
And I hoped, that this, wasn't goodbye
But I can't help but wonder what went wrong
To make "forever" dead and gone


You said "I don't want your body but I know that you can find yourself somebody else"
Our love has gone cold and it doesn't feel like home when I hold you close

You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee 
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry  Oh
Cause I'm needing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry  Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say

I'm sorry, baby
Yeah I'm sorry, sorry
Sorry
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this 
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry  Oh
Cause I'm needing more than just your body, baby
Is it too late now to say sorry  Oh
Cause I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say
I'm sorry, baby
Sorry, oh

Angela
She wears it like a dress
A post-traumatic mess


And don't sleep
It hurts to be awake
The things they make her take
Angela, Angela

Oh, we don t speak
She stayed an extra week
Oh, I see her in my sleep
Angela, oh Angela
Why do you talk so loud 
Why do you talk so 
Why do you talk so loud 
Why do you talk so 
Passing grammatical mistakes
Totally wrecked and polemic in the way he talks
Vocal sabbatical, delayed by churning out the same

We don't got alarms we just use my Dad's arms
Excess until we stop hearts
"I think you're trying too hard with your lungs in tar
And your kitchen full of pop stars"


And I've been thinking lots about your mouth
A conversation superseded by the way he talks
I'd be an anchor but I'm scared you'd drown
It's safer on the ground







Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel

One taught me love
One taught me patience
One taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say


Thank you, next 
I'm so grateful for my-
Thank you, next 
I'm so grateful for my-


Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that

We are right now in the beginning of a climate and ecological crisis
And  we need to call it what it is
An  emergency
We must acknowledge that we do not have the situation under control
And  that we don't have all the solutions yet
Unless those solutions mean that we simply stop doing certain things
We must admit that we are losing this battle
We have to acknowledge that the older generations have failed
All  political movements in their present form have failed
But Homo sapiens have not yet failed
Yes, we are failing, but there is still time to turn everything around
We can still fix this
We still have everything in our own hands
But unless we recognise the overall failures of our current systems
We most probably don't stand a chance
We are facing a disaster of unspoken sufferings for enormous amounts of people
And now is not the time for speaking politely or focusing on what we can or cannot say
Now is the time to speak clearly
Solving the climate crisis is the greatest and most complex challenge that Homo sapiens have ever faced
The main solution, however, is so simple that even a small child can understand it
We have to stop our emissions of greenhouse gases
And either we do that, or we don't
You say that nothing in life is black or white
But that is a lie, a very dangerous lie
Either we prevent a 1.5 degree of warming, or we don't
Either we avoid setting off that irreversible chain reaction beyond human control, or we don't
Either we choose to go on as our civilization, or we don't
That is as black or white as it gets
Because there are no grey areas when it comes to survival

Now, we all have a choice
We can create transformational action that will safeguard the living conditions for future generations
Or we can continue with our business as usual and fail
That is up to you and me
And yes, we need a system change rather than individual change
But you cannot have one without the other
If you look through history
All the big changes in society have been started by people at the grassroots level
People like you and me
So, I ask you to please wake up and make the changes required possible
To do your best is no longer good enough
We must all do the seemingly impossible
Today, we use about 100 million barrels of oil every single day
There are no politics to change that
There are no rules to keep that oil in the ground
So, we can no longer save the world by playing by the rules
Because the rules have to be changed
Everything needs to change, and it has to start today
So, everyone out there, it is now time for civil disobedience
It is time to rebel
And well, I think I've gone mad
Isn't that so sad 
And what a shame you've lost a brain that you never had
Oh, mum, check the car it can t have gone far
I must have left it on a train or lost in a bar
It s likely in a Sainsbury s
Flirting with the girls and waiting for me
I jumped on a bus, declared my name
And asked if anybody's seen my brain
"Your brain was last seen going for a run
And would you sign an autograph for my daughter Laura 
'Cause she adores you
But I think you re shit"
"I've gotta look for my brain for a bit! 
I stepped outside, it hurt my eyes
 Well what do you expect when you ve got no mind! 
I searched all day it drove me insane
 Where would I be if I was my brain  




The nice nurse told me she felt my pain
But she couldn't find a single trace of my brain
"Oops!... I Did It Again" started playing
Forget my brain, remember my name
Hello
There's a place
I've been going
There's a place I've been going
Now I'm clean
It would seem
Let's go somewhere I'll be seen
As sad as it seems
I seen Greg and he was like
"I seen your friends at the birthday party
They were kinda fucked up before it even started
They were gonna go to the Pinegrove show
They didn't know about all the weird stuff
So they just left it" 
I was wasted 
And cold
And minding my business


And I seen the girls and they were all like
"Do you wanna come and get fucked up "
Listen, I got myself a missus, says there can't be any kissing
"No, don't be a fridge, you better wise up, kid
It's all Adderall now, it doesn't make you wanna do it"

Don't call it a fight when you know it's a war
With nothing but your t-shirt on
And go sit on the bed because you know that you want to
You've got pretty eyes, but I know you're wrong
And don't call it a spade if it isn't a spade
Go lie on the floor if you want
The first bit of advice that you gave me that I liked was "They're too strong, too strong"
Get in the shower if it all goes wrong

Yeah, you wanna find love then you know where the city is

Community service was the best job he ever had
Cleaning up
He got sick on the floor and his shoes


Oh, and she said "It's your birthday, are you feeling alright "
The next one's the MD, you'll be feeling just fine
Your brother is just sat there, you said you felt snide
You hope that, that the boy will be alright

You gotta love it cause you got all of your friends




You are mine, I ve been drowning in you
You fracture light again
Beautiful, please don't cry, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside
I wake up, love you, so I love you, so I say I love you, love you, love you
Cry
I wake up, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
You wait for a bit

Pissed again, I've been dying to meet you
You fracture light again 
I love you, oh, I love you
When you leave, I cry on the inside


Oh, so I love this, I love you, so love you, love you, love you, love you
Cry
I will love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
We're supposed to leave by half-past eight
Will you stay or wait *british nonsense*
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound

Oh baby won't you cum again 
She said "I've got a problem with your shoes
And your tunes, but I might move in
And I thought that you were straight, now I'm wondering"


You're so conceited, I said "I love you"
What does it matter if I lie to you 
I don't regret it but I'm glad that we're through
So don't you tell me that you "just don't get it"
Cause I know you do


Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound
I know the sound, of your heart
Well I know when you're around cause I know the sound

It's not about reciprocation, it's just all about me
A sycophantic, prophetic, Socratic junkie wannabe
There's so much skin to see
A simple Epicurean philosophy
And you say I'm such a clich 
I can't see the difference in it either way
And we left things to protect my mental health
But you'll call me when you're bored and you're playing with yourself

Well I know when you're around 'cause I know the sound

London, thank you so much for making this such an incredible, special evening for us. We've only just fucking started!


Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound

Let's go! One, two!


Well, I know when you're around cause I know the sound

This feeling
It's not something I wanted
It's something I needed 

Cause' when I got that feeling
It's not something I wanted
It's something I needed 

Cause' when I felt that feeling
It's not something I wanted
It's something I needed 

So one more time with feeling
It's not something I wanted
It's something I needed
I personify the "adolescent on a phone"
Speaking like I'm bigger than my body
I personify that lack of freedom in your life
And I'm sure she'll be gone in a second
Let me tell you 'bout this girl
I thought she'd rearrange my world
Takes a particular type of girl
To put my heart under arrest
So why's this beating on my chest 

Wide awake before I found you

I can't wait for you boy

What does all our love amount to 

We can't make love when you fly around me baby


Pipe down, you're no lover
It's failing 'cause you want it to
Well, I thought it was love but I guess I must be dreaming
'Bout feeling something instead of you
The young stale memories of, play the role to your part
Librarian find me the pole the one that kicks your head in
To my own time role your own innocence by
Grab on to my sleeve the one that grabs at your ankle
Debate to understand that we all have a flaw
Then fail to represent your life as you know it
God grant you one wish to turn back the time
Correct and create, making sense of...

Me and my star, Matthew good night
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star, Matthew good night
You know my Lord, when you'll be forgiven

So they pulled your confidence down with those verbal discrepancies
Now and then you'll gain what they've lost through a challenge of unpronounced
Pain is only a pulse if you just stop feeling it
You might be able to use the very thing that makes us up

Me and my star, Matthew good night
You know by law, when you'll be forgiven
Maria my star, Matthew good night
You know my Lord

Wait, now, here when will you believe 
Me, I'm merely asking you to help me
When did I say to murder 
Wait, now, here. Please hear me out
Time consumer, time consuming, consume me
Down, and out
Now

I tell you I can visualise it all
Too real it all seems
But once again, runnin' away with me
Once again  runnin' away with me
This couldn't be a dream
Runnin' away with me
Runnin' away with me


And I stop myself for a minute
See if my heart's still in it
Say a few things just to win it
Funny how it works out  innit 
And I told her  "Some things have their time
How can I be yours if you're not mine "
She said, "They should take this pain
And give it a name"


Tonight, I wish I was your boy

I 
Tonight, I think I fucked it royally



You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight
And I'll define it
I swear that I 
I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times 
I don't think it was three times
It can't be more than four times
I think we need to rewind
You text that boy sometimes
Must be more than three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you

She said that I should have liked it
I told her "I only use it sometimes"
Except when I need reminding
I'm petrified
But I only called her one time
Maybe it was two times 
I don't think it was three times
I didn't mean to two-time, two-time you


You wet my eyes
But I don't mind it
I tell you lies
But it's only sometimes
You pick a fight

I didn't mean to two-time you, two-time you
To two-time, two-time you

Madison Square Garden, look at us
How fucking sick are we 
Fuck you!

Not you guys, not you guys
Let's go, ayy

You pick a fight
And I'll define it

Hey, boy, stop pacing 'round the room
Using other people's faces as a mirror for you
I know your lungs need filling
Since your gums have lost their feeling
But don't say that you're giving it up again
"Do you have a card 
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself"
It's just a simple diarrhetic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me
When I said I liked it better without my money, I lied
It took a little while to recognize that I, I'm not giving it up again
This conversation's not about reciprocation no more
But I'm gon' wait until you finish so I can talk some more
About me and my things, my car, my living
And how I'm giving it up, giving it up again
And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me

"Do you have a card 
My irregular heart beat is starting to correct itself," baby
Oh, it's just a simple diuretic that prevents the empathetic
From being just and giving it up

You sing it


And you're the only thing that's going on in my mind
Taking over my life a second time
I don't have the capacity for fucking
You're meant to be helping me

Twist around the lounge
Sun drowns the house
Stick another pill in my head and go to bed
We're not doing it again so leave it
I didn't even see you when I liked you
Now I ain't got no time
Girl, I wanna see you undo it
I wanna see you but you're not mine
Bombs have run out
Call 'round the town
"I could hear you giving her head," she said
You think we're doing it again  Keep dreaming

You're insecure, don't know what for
You're turning heads when you walk through the door
Don't need makeup to cover up
Being the way that you are is enough


Everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you


Baby you light up my world like nobody else
The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
But when you smile at the ground it ain't hard to tell
You don't know, oh oh, you don't know you're beautiful
If only you saw what I can see
You'll understand why I want you so desperately
Right now I'm looking at you and I can't believe
You don't know, you don't know you're beautiful
That's what makes you beautiful

Oh, come on, you got it wrong
To prove I'm right I put it in a song
You're acting shy, I don't know why
I can tell by the look in your eyes


And everyone else in the room can see it
Everyone else but you

They're calling out your name
What should I say  What should I say

Tell 'em that Ambien makes me crazy
What did you say 
Tell 'em again, tell 'em that thing that you told me
What should I say  What should I say

Our first kiss was Christmas in the Walmart toy department
She said, "I should take you with me when I leave"
We were searchin' New York for a fancy, new apartment
She said, "Central Park is Sea World for trees"
You ask about the cows, wearin' my sweater
It's somethin' about the weather that makes them lie down
The only time I feel I might get better is when we are together


I like socks with sandals, she's mor  into scented candles
Oh, I'll n ver get that smell out of my bag
It was poorly handled
The day we both got canceled
Because I'm a racist and you're some kind of slag
You ask about the cows, wearin' my sweater
It's somethin' about the weather that makes them lie down
The only time I feel I might get better is when we are together



"I'm better at writin'" was just a way to get you bitin'
Oh, the truth is that our egos are absurd
I thought we were fightin'
But it seems I was gaslightin' you
I didn't know that it had its own word

She walks down the stairs, feeling herself
Lookin' like she just won a court case
He's got a funny way of using the same
Four chords for every song he makes
He's called Bill and he plays with words
Like a skill, yeah he's pretty great
He said his official friend died 'cause of a officiate
Yeah, she's called Hannah and she plays the Joanna
Grade eight but she's got no soul
John's obsessed with fat ass and h 's ten years old
Oh, Dad's an Otis Redding at a w dding type guy
With the best voice you ever heard
He said, "Give me a date I can work on, my heart hurts"


I get home on the twenty-third
I'll drive up on the twenty-third


And I bumped into Julie in the co-op
She asked how the family's been
I said, "Alex is a sculptor and Olivia's been a vegan since ten
While Vin wears dresses while Debbie coalesces in a fleece that doesn't work
And I'll be givin' my chair to my Mum 'cause her back hurts"

She mistakes my name
I see the light come around
Strange as it seems
I'm bursting at the seams
And oh, I've got a woman now
Her wallet photos don't turn me on
I feel her hand come around
And her stone-wash denim jeans are darker than they seem
And oh, I've got a woman now
She said, "My name is Eileen, boy that's all you need
Oh, and this one's on the house, I don't mind"
It all tastes the same
And boy, there's something different about your mouth
And you try chasing dreams, man, it's harder than it seems
And oh, I've got a woman now
And oh, I've got a woman now

And you're a liar
At least all of your friends are
And so am I
Just typically drowned in my car
It's my party
And I'll cry to the end
You must try harder
Than kissing all of my friends, you
Yeah, it takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
It takes a bit more
Yeah, it takes a bit more than you
And you're alive
At least as far as I can tell you are
And so am I
You beat me down and then we're back to my car
And it's so ironic
How it's only been a year
And it's not my fault
That I fucked everybody here
Said I m tried of cleaning
Said come back soon
Sons are tired of the real thing
Playing out
A mean, a mean

An' Lord knows
It s gets harder
When you re scared
Wherever you are
I could still have you
I could still have you
I could still have you
We re not young now
We grew older
Only fight
When you re sober
I know it s hard when
She s your mother
But he s your father

But sometimes
On magazines
He an' I say
You're embarrassing

An' I know
You get scared
Wherever you are
I could still have you
I could still have you
I could still have you

We re not young now
We grew older
Only fight
When you re sober
I know it s hard when
She s your mother
But he s your father

Said I'm tired from cleaning, so come back soon
Some are tired from their well being, oh yeah, oh I mean, I mean
Lord knows it gets harder
When you're scared, wherever you are
I could still have him
I could still have him
I could still have him


Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you re sober
I know its hard cuz' she s your mother
An' he s your father


And some of the times, in magazines
He and I say, your embarrassing
Lord knows it gets harder
If your scared then, come wake you up
I could still have him
I could still have him
I could still have him


Here we are now, We grew older
I only find you, when you re sober
I know its hard cuz' she s your mother
An' he s your father
