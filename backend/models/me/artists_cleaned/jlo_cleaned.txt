Hoy he venido a despedirme
A hablar de tantas cosas que nunca quisiste oirme
Y ya no quiero mas excusas
Tu nunca tienes tiempo se te escapo la musa


Adios, Adios
Me voy, Adios
Y no me dejas ni tan solo la esperanza
Adios, amor, adios


Si hay una lagrima en mis ojos
Es que voy recogiendo de mi vida los trozos
Si hemos jugado a una aventura
Nos hemos embriagado con tragos de locura


Adios, Adios
Me voy, Adios
Y no me dejas ni tan solo la esperanza
Adios, amor, adios
Adios, Adios
Me voy, Adios
Y no me dejas ni tan solo la esperanza
Adios, amor, adios

One more time
One, two, three


Long nights in your car, mornings in your arms
From five hour calls to nothing at all
I guess time's a sign, writing on the wall, ooh
Don't know where it all went wrong


But if this is how it's got to be
I need someone to tell me, tell me, tell me, tell me


What comes after love 
I wanna know there's something for me after us
I don't think my heart was made to break this much
Tell me there is happy ever after love
Tell m  there is happy ev r after us


I know you said that this was meant to be
Now these words are ancient history
At least I get to keep the memories, uh
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall
Will somebody catch me when I fall 
So then I'll keep on dancing on my own

Like an angel, out the sky you came
Clearing up all the clouds, the sadness and the rain
So pure and healing was the love you bring
I knew inside it felt so right


For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love

I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again


I was scared to let go and trust your love
After what I've been through, I have had enough
Whispering through your eyes, you never said a word
But something said, "You're insane"


For me, I've struggled all my life
To find that thing that makes it right
With you, it seems I may have found
Some other kind of love


I will love you all my life
Always be by your side
And I will give you all I have
'Cause you gave me peace and joy again
Again, again

Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti


It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me
It's so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be
But there are facts in our lives we can never change
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same
This perfect romance that I've created in my mind 
I'd live a thousand lives, each one with you right by my side
But yet we find ourselves in a less-than-perfect circumstance 
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance

Ain't it funny how some feelings you just can't deny 
And you can't move on even though you try  
Ain't it strange when you're feeling things you shouldn't feel 
Oh, I wish this could be real
Ain't it funny how a moment could just change your life 
And you don't want to face what's wrong or right  
Ain't it strange how fate can play a part
In the story of your heart 


Sometimes I think that a true love can never be 
I just believe that somehow it wasn't meant for me 
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain
And I don't think that I could face it all again
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about 
A deeper love I've found in you, and I no longer doubt 
You've touched my heart, and it altered every plan I've made
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid

Oye, you know the drama 
It goes something like this

It must be the ass that got me like damn
If they get any fatter, man, the Rule going to have to get at her
And our situation won't matter
I come to make you smile in the freakiest manners
J to the L-O, hello
No, I'm not Lee Harvey Oswald
I'm the Rule and I shot call
"Off the Wall" like MJ in his early days
It's the Inc. and Lopez now
Ain't that funny 
It's been a while since you came around
Now you want to see what's going down
Tryna tell me why you want my time
Tryna tell m  how I'm on your mind
See, it never had to be this way
You should hav  never played the games you played
Now I'm seeing that you're kind of lame
Knowing how the situation change

Ain't that funny  
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
Now I can smile and say
Ain't that funny  
Baby, that you want me
When you had me
Love is crazy
I'm glad I can smile and say
Ain't that funny 

I remember how you walked away
Even when I tried to call your name
See at first I didn't understand
Now you're looking like a lonely man
I remember how you did me wrong
And now you're hurting 'cause my love is gone
Everybody gets a chance to burn
You can take it as a lesson learned

With a view of the islands, sittin' on top the sea  with it)
Like fuck everybody watchin', can you focus on me  
And promise not to choose nobody els   
I can't do this by myself 
Give you all of me 'cause with you bae I'm really at my best

Know you had some bitches, them the ones that you would lie to
But you keep it one hunnind with me 
You keep it so gutter with me 
Ran me up a bag and you still never want nothing from me

You're the only one for me 

Time goes slowly now in my life
Fear no more of what I'm not sure


Searching to feel your soul
The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go


I guess I've found my way
It's simple when it's right
Feeling lucky just to be here, tonight
And happy just to be me
And be alive

Love in and out of my, my heart
And though life can be strange, I can't be afraid
Searching to feel your soul


The strength to stand alone
The power of not knowing and letting go

Can't take the way you mistreated me 
And it's crazy, but oh, baby 
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man


Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son 
I gotta leave you alone 
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block 
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right  


All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone  Huh

Love is life and life is living
It's very special

The nights I waited up for you 
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you 
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town 
I thought my tender touch could lock you down 
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now 
Stop playing , you gaming
I gotta leave you alone 


'Cause I'm good holding my spot
Stop acting like that
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block
Now you know you need to stop
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right 
Here we go

Love is life and life is living
It's very special
All my love 
Please do not adjust your dials
You are about to experience a Ignorants remix
All my love
Baby, don't go
All my love
Baby, don't go
Yeah, yeah
Baby, don't go
Baby, don't go


It's such a shame, but I'm leaving 
Can't take the way you mistreated me 
And it's crazy, but oh, baby 
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me
I don't believe you wanna leave like this
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby, let's talk about this, man


Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son 
I gotta leave you alone 
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block 
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right  

Love is life and life is living

Well, I'm bouncing and I'm out, son 
I gotta leav  you alone 
'Cause I'm good, holding down my spot
And I'm good r ppin' the girls on the block 
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock
So without me you'll be fine, right  


All my pride is all I have
Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have
You'll be needing me, but too bad
Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad
The path you chose to run alone
I know you're independent, you can make it on your own
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah
But time is of the essence, why spend it alone  Huh


The nights I waited up for you 
Promises you made about coming through
So much time you wasted
That's why I had to replace you 
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settling down
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town 
I thought my tender touch could lock you down 
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now 
Stop playing , you gaming
I gotta leave you alone

Te invade el coraz n
Este amor que a veces nula la raz n
Y no te deja pensar
Me siento as  tambi n
Desde el d a en que te vi, me enamor 
Y ya no puedo callarlo m s

Mi amor es para siempre
Tu amor es mi raz n, mi paz
Es mi fe, mi luz, mi  nica verdad
Amor es dar, sin nada que esperar
Eres como te so  
Y tu sonrisa el sol de cada amanecer
Sin ti no s  como respirar
Contigo quiero despertar
En tu cuerpo descubrir mi otra mitad
Me ense aste a ser mujer

Vienes envuelto en el silencio
Vienes detr s de una mirada
O en el temor de un beso
Detr s de las peque as cosas que
Me hacen sentir la emoci n de creer
Entras en mi tan sutilmente
Invisible como el aire mismo
Me asaltas y jam s me adviertes que
Es el amor el que abraza esta piel, esta piel


Amarte as  es pleno y es total
Amarte es todo
Amarte as  es locura y libertad
Amarte es todo
Amarte hasta llenar mi vida
De sue os y de fantas as
Amarte as  me da seguridad


Y quien puede contra tu boca
Que me hace hasta pedir auxilio
Y quien puede con tus detalles que
Me hacen vivir y sentirme mujer, mujer
NoneLetra de "Amor Amor Amor" ft. Wisin

Damas y Caballeros
W
Los poderes


Dos cuerpos entregados
Un par de enamorados
Flechados, cansados
Sudor desenfrenado
Cuando t  y yo nos juntamos
Sin piedad 
Nos damos

Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo


La la la eh, el sudor en tu piel
A m  me vuelves loco
Tus besos saben a miel
Ahora, eh!
Quiero tu desnudez
A m  si t  te vuelves lo hacemos otra vez
Cuando se pone el babydoll  Uf, arrasa!
Una copa de vino y tumba la casa
No s  qu  me pasa
Pero cuando me abrasa
Con su fuego me traspasa
Y en el medio de la cama se entrega
Siempre pa' alante
Sabe como se breva
Y se pega, se pega


Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida, siento que vuelo
Cuando hacemos el amor
Amor, amor, amor
Vuelvo a la vida cuando toco tu cuerpo

Apresurate amor mio
Que me pesan las memorias
Que el recuerdo y el silencio
No confundan nuestras cosas
Apresurate que el tiempo vuela
Que amenaza con la cruel rutina
Y se quiere llevar los momentos
Mas felices de la vida


Por los dos por lo que siempre hemos sentido
Por todo lo que vivimos apresurate mi amor
Por que vuelvan los minutos porque no quiero perderte
Porque vivo de ilusiones, porque sueno con amarte hoy

Que los dias se van y es dificil otra oportunidad
Para estar asi, para volver a amar
Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi
Ven apresura, te ruego
No lo pensemos mas, que los dos nacimos para sonar
Y no quiero estar sola un minuto mas
Quedate junto a mi, quedate junto a mi
Ven apresura, te ruego


Es tan necesario que estes de mi lado
La distancia puede lastimar mis fuerzas
Puedo resistir con mucho empeno
Pero el miedo me doblega
Ese miedo a verme nuevamente sola
A pensar que tanto amor ha sido en vano
Es por eso que te necesito
En mis dias y en mi espacio


Por los dos por lo que siempre hemos luchado
Por todo lo que pasamos apresurate mi amor
Por que vuelvan los minutos, porque no quiero perderte
Porque vivo de ilusiones porque sueno con amarte hoy

Como La Flor
Con tanto amor
Me diste TU
Se Marchito
Me marcho hoy
Yo se perder
Pero ay.....
Como me duele


Paripititumon! Hey, hey, hey, yeah!
Cada vez
Cada vez que lo oigo hablar...

Me canta as , as ...
"Bidi bidi bom bom...

 yeme, te necesito
Contigo quiero llegar hasta viejito


Como t  quieres so ar
Con alguien que no quiere ni dormir contigo
Cuando tienes fr o no te da su abrigo
Boy, I never knew I could feel
The way I felt, when I felt
The way you were feeling me, baby
I'm so out of control, yeah
Every time you look my way
I realize more and more
How much I adore those pretty eyes of yours
I'm helpless, baby


What I want to know is
Are you willing to try 
Can you love me for a lifetime
In just one night  Oh


Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you 
Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you

Baby, I love you 
You know I need you
Gotta have you 
Can't be without you 


It's like downtown New York in the middle of traffic jams
All I really want you to know is who I am
You can find me low-key in the back of the club
Or with some fine females, rollin' on dubs
You and me big pimpin' on a shopping spree in L.A
Paparazzi's and critics, who give a damn what they say 

Boy, I never knew I could feel the way I felt when I met you
I could never forget you
And boy, when you look my way 
I realize more and more I adore your pretty eyes


But what I wanna know from you is do you wanna share my love's bliss 
I long for the day when I'm feeling your kiss 
Can you love me for a lifetime for just in one night 
I'm helpless for you, baby, but it's alright 


Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you 
Baby, I love you 
Baby, I need you 
I gotta have you 
Can't be without you


Papi, I got something to say to you 


Blessed and cursed on the day that I felt the power of you  
Inside me, it was strong and I loved it 
And there comes a time in our lives when things change 
And baby, I'll spend it with you

What's up, baby 
It's your new boyfriend
Royce


Oh yeah
You know, this got that dance hall feel to it
Prince Royce

De tantas formas te quiero tocar
Tantos secretos voy a descifrar
Y yo quiero hacerte el amor

I won t stop 'til I get to the top
I m so, I m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
I won t stop 'til I get to the top
I m so, I m so Becky from the block
Always had a little, but I want a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
Yo, first grade, Oak Street elementary
A few blocks from the Inglewood cemetery
I lived through hard times, according to my memory
Then I learned to rhyme like I m reading out the dictionary
I still walk to the Kelso Market
Even though I get to walk them red carpets
My family lived in my grandpa s garage
So I started working just to help out my pops
It all started when my grandpa crossed over
Now one day I'mma be a crossover
Right now it s just "Who is that girl "
But one day I'mma be all around the world
I still get grounded, always stay grounded
Still do chores even when I m on tour
One thing s for sure, I'mma always be me
That West Side Becky, Becky, Becky, Becky G

Looking through a coffee table book
At a small cafe on Broadway
Trying to find a way out of all trouble and dismay
Traveling on a road unpaved
Everywhere I look there's something there to remind me
Of feelings from yesterday
Listening to drama and hearsay only leaves me empty



You are my friend first
We talk about what hurts
We talk about love
Let's talk about us
Can't you see I want you to be mine 
What matters the most
I just want to see you up close
When I look into your heart
You got everything I want
Can't you see I want you to be mine 


You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine 
You do what hasn't been done before
No one loves you more than me
Can't you see I want you to be mine 
I want you to be mine

Help me when I'm at a loss for words
Bring up all my memories folder please, in the temporal lobe
False loving when I was illogical
Didn't know they held each other's hands 'cause they made one whole


Brain stem yells temperature
Arise now, sweat raindrops down my silky flesh
Buttering up my consciousness
Cook, cook, cook now
Ability to sleep sound
Throughout the star, time's an illusion
If you just remove it

When did humans start to separate brain and heart
As if they could stay alive alone 
Flip it around the other way
If they were apart and you had no power start
Or no database
Only your shell remains
What fun is it to be so calculated
Or be taken advantage of 'cause your heart's too trusting 
Silent expressed, push my head into my chest
Bind them up, forever wed
"Don't drift too far," they said


Help me when I'm too detached and cold
Give me the vitality that I need to trust love more
Blood to the water, neither can fuel us alone
Fervency in my arteries, passion bloomin' through my bones


Heartstrings trigger emotions, dreams
Agape love's a journey, red rivers connect all of me
B-b-beat steadfast, don't you disappoint me
Sometimes I think you're all I need
Wise beyond belief

It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been Heaven sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting it, I'm loving it
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gon' use me
And after he'll never call again
Don't be afraid , don't be afraid 
This is your day , this is your day

It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed
It just ain't the same
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
'Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way 
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave
I am brave, I am brave
Yeah, ooh
Oh, oh, ooh


I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
'Cause the same way, I'm scared of him
He's scared of being hurt again
It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
Baby, don't be afraid , don't be afraid 
This is your day , this is your day

It's a new day, new day, and it's evident
You must have been Heaven sent
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all
Just feeling more confident
Just using my common sense
Just trusting it, I'm loving it
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent
Can't assume he's gonna use me
And after he'll never call again

Don't be afraid , don't be afraid 
This is your day , this is your day


It's time to be brave
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore
I used to be cold, now the temp rature's changed
It just ain't the sam 
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid
Cause I've become brave as the light of day
Straight into a cave to show me the way 
That I might be saved
Now I'm turning the page
Thanks to the power of love I can love
Because I am brave


I am brave
Oh, oh, ooh
I am brave
Yeah, ooh


I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him
It's a feeling that I'm straddling
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes
Really wish he would let me in
But the same way, I'm scared of him
Scared of being in hurt again
It's time to let go, let go of your heart
It's time for a brand new start
Never know, we might never part
None


Nobody's breaking me down

My body's against the wall

UnrelesasedOh yeah

Ohhh

Oh yeah

My girls came by
They sat me down
And they started telling me how
When you are gone
Your not at work
Said your with other women
Your such a jerk
I didn't want
To hear anymore
So I asked them to leave
And slammed the door
I didn't want to realize
My man was living a double life

I get the feeling that you don't give a shit
Your caught out there
And your not discreet with it
And everybody knows who I am
And you don't give a damn, ho!

How can you just say that you love me, yet to leave you alone 
You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me know


What is it, love  Can I help you 
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to
I've looked to you enough

I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you 
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving


Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say
And the only thing that you could have done, you choose to walk away


I'm thankful, love, I don't hate you
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through
I needed you somehow


I can't believe this is me
Where I can touch and not feel you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
You know you owe it to me
How can you think we don't need you 
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
I can't believe this is me
I was a fool to believe you
I feel I'm lost in a dream between what is and what seems
Having to face not to need you
How could you do this to me 
How can you think we don't need you 
I'm tired of running away from my fear
And the day that our life has no meaning
Without a word or a reason
Like a coward, you're leaving
Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone
Like I want you, babe
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside
I got so much love


Oh baby, when I get near you
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling, baby
I got so much love to give you
That I would probably want you all the time

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o


I wish that I could spend all my days and nights
Wrapped in your arms spending time with you
Because all I see in this world is me and you and no one else
Ooh, I want you more and more


Oh baby, please understand me
I think that you deserve me, oh, yeah
Because I'm the type that would give you
All the love and affection that you need


Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o
Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, qu date conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o

Baby, yo con nadie me podria imajinar
Lo que estoy sintiendo
Tocaz lo mas fondo de mi sensibilidad
Solo con tu amor


Cuando tu estas a mi lado, ooh
Hecho volar los sentidoes, oh yeah
Y valez todo mi cuerpo
Contigo siento que llego mas alla

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o



Estas en mi
Escondido en cada beso que me das
Como lo haces tu
Estas aqui
Y no hay nadie mas que ocupe tu lugar
Este amor es unico


Soy toda tuya, no temas
Asi como deseas, oh yeah
Eso que tu necisitas
Es lo mas que consigues tu de mi


Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o quedate conmigo, cari o

Cari o, cari o


 I was
 I was
 I was
 I was


Break it, you buy it, nothing's for free
Especially my body, especially me
Break it, you bought it, I pray that you don't
Don't do what all guys do, do what all guys do


First we're getting to be social then you're turning dishonest
Think that running the street's worth it
That just turns months into weeks into days
I ain't willing to be cordial, I'm just speaking to your conscience 


You wanna take it but I won't give it away 
Leave me in a mess I never made 
Tryna play a game I never learned 
No one ever wins a love charade
You think that you're the only one to ever say
You love me when it's over

Running out of juice
It's a matter of seconds now, I'm shutting down 
Desperate when I move
My battery is screaming loud, I'm shutting down 


It's an addiction, I, I, I want more, more, more
Give me some boom, boom, boom
Give me some oh, oh, oh
Kickstart my engine with a hundred thousand volts
Ignite the room, room, room
I'm going loco, oh


Stroke me down like lightning volts
Take control of my body, every single bone
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again
I'm dancing in your danger zone
So wired up, but I just want another dose
I come alive when you charge me up, baby
Charge me up, baby, charge me up, once and again


Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Charge me up once and again



Tanto tempo j  vai caminhando
E ainda me pego recordando
L grimas rolaram dos meus olhos
Enxuguei mais de uma vez
Tenho algumas marcas que ficaram em meu sorriso nesses anos
E tamb m lembran as t o bonitas que o tempo n o desfez
Quem diria que voc  viria sem dizer que vinha 
Porque nunca   tarde
Para apaixonar-se

Chegaste
Senti na minha boca um "te quero"
Como um doce com caramelo
Necessitava um amor sincero
Chegaste
E ouvi da tua boca um "te quero"
Pra se apaixonar sempre   tempo
Necessitava um amor sincero


E agora que eu conhe o os caminhos que me levam pros seus bra os
Agora que o sil ncio   uma car cia que a felicidade traz
Voc  e o seu sorriso iluminam minha vida e meus espa os
E chega me dizendo num sorriso "n o me deixe nunca mais"


Quem diria que voc  viria sem dizer que vinha 
Porque nunca   tarde
Para apaixonar-se
Chegaste
Senti na minha boca um "te quero"
Como um doce com caramelo
Necessitava um amor sincero
Chegaste
E ouvi da tua boca um "te quero"
Pra se apaixonar sempre   tempo
Necessitava um amor sincero

What  What  What  Hey
Yeah, you


You had a dark, sexy vibe about you
And in a strange way you turn me on
The way you look said a lot about you
As if you really didn't give a uh
I told myself not to fall for you
Because I can see that you don't follow rules
I should have just walked away
But your eyes were telling me to stay

Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on 


It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like


A real rebel kind of fellow
The kind that I would never trust
I could read what your mind was thinking
It's like you still didn't give a hey
It's funny how those kind of guys
Have a way of getting what they want
And even good girls, though they try
You see, they just can't seem to stay away


Damn, why do the wild ones turn me on 


It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
That's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
That's what it feels like
It is like cherry pie, you can't deny it
Driving fast, you had to try it
Oh, that's what it feels like
Letting Tony touch you everywhere
Breaking rules and didn't care
Oh, baby, that's what it feels like

Brothers and sisters
We are gathered here today to join this man and this woman in holy matrimony


I'm sittin  on top of cloud number nine
Yeah, I'm goin' up, I m gettin' so high
No, I'm not the same since you came around
You're testin' my faith, I'm prayin' out loud


I feel it in my chest, I feel it in my chest
I got you in my head, I got you in my head
I'm puttin  on my best, I m puttin' on my best

I'm callin' for you now, I'm callin  out your name
And I wanna make you proud, got me feelin' saved
So I'm gonna sing it out, it's a new day
Like I'm in church, church, church, church


You make me feel like I'm in heaven
I'm comin' out with my confession
Like church, church, church, church, church, church, church
Like church, church, church, church, yeah

Maybe, I need to see you
Oh, oh, oh
Please, come over


One, you come to my room for a little game
To you, I'll do very erotic things
I want to make love, babe, very slowly
Three times in a row, all night I'll go

I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over


Body next to mine, love dance, syncopated time
Sugar rush keeps me high, sweet kiss on my thigh
I wanna make love, baby, very badly
Feels good in the air every time you're here


I love when you come over
Please come over
And when you come, it gives me fever
Come over


Don't keep me waiting, anticipating
Love, I am saving for you 
Hear what I'm saying, you I am craving
Love is here waiting for you 
All day you're staying, please no delaying 
Patiently waiting for you
Don't keep me waiting, no time for playing
Sitting here waiting for you



Quiz s me he apresurado a pisar sin ver los pasos
A dejar que las heridas no sanaran bien
Quiz s por impetuosa he dejado tantas cosas
Que eran parte del camino, parte de crecer
Quizas porque tan solo he sido una
Que ha sido enamorada de la luna
Tan solo eso ha sido mi pecado
El de seguir mi coraz n a todos lados
Seguir mi loco coraz n a todos lados

He amado como ama una mujer
Que ve en su hombre el paraiso
Si me entregu , lo hice total
Y si fall , volv  a empezar
Y a levantarme en el camino
Yo he amado como ama una mujer
Que el alma no la ha abandonado
Y que lo intenta un d a m s
Y que ha sonado con sonar
Y por amar se ha equivocado
Y por amar se ha equivocado


Quiz s no habido espacio para ver bastante claro
Y al final de la jornada tuve que perder
Si me ha llevado el viento, he vivido mis momentos
Y al final en mi conciencia solo tuve fe
Y s lo por seguir esta locura
De la pasi n que r pido se esfuma
Tan solo por creerlo nuevamente
Por no caer y a veces no desvanecerme
Por toda la necesidad de hacerme fuerte


He amado como ama una mujer

The club was far from empty
It was crowded at the entry 
I slide right through like how I do
This girl began to tempt me 
She said her name Shayeeda
I could tell her mama feed her 
When they tight and thick them jeans don't fit

The room just started turning
Didn't want to go out on the floor
But this girl was so determined
My brain began to sizzle

On the dance floor in the middle
She turned around and giggled

You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make me leave my man
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
You got, you got, you got
What it takes to make this boy go bad
It's hard to control myself
It's hard to control myself
Come on, yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too
You got, you got
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, me too



Ahora empieza, tu dolor de cabeza
Provocative nina traviesa
Vamos dale apunta y dispara, y
O voy a dejar, que me maten tus balas
Soy anzuelo, pa tus peces
Vamos a morirnos, como viernes 13
Fuera bruja sin escoba
Estas en mi reino y te pongo corona

Down, me gusta verte abajo
Movimiento, down, down
Sabes como hacerlo
Desde el norte al downtown
Tienes mucho tiempo
Yo soy woman del Brasil
Hoy quiero susurrarte despacito


Corazon, si no te tengo aqu 
Ya no me vale nadie
Pues sin ti el meu cora  o
A mi me arde, me arde
Corazon, si no te tengo aqu 
Ya no me vale nadie
Pues sin ti el meu cora  o
A mi me arde, me arde


Que, que, pa' alla es que voy
Que, que, pa' alla es que voy
Que, que, que mi digan ahora donde
Es el party 
Que, que, pa' alla es que voy
Que, que, pa' alla es que voy
Que, que, que mi digan

Oh, oh
Love makes no promises


If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love 


How, tell me how will I know 
Will my heart make me believe it so 
Or can I trust the way I feel 
If you could read my mind 
You see how hard I have tried 
Still, I can't decide

If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love 
Tell me could this be love 
El amor no hace promesas


Do you know if it's true 
That real love lasts a lifetime
Does it shine like the stars up in the sky 
And do you know  if you can fall for just a moment 
Is a moment for all time 


Why, why am I so unsure 
Is that love knocking at my door 
Or the sound of my beating heart 
If you could read my mind 
You know I just can't hide 
What I feel inside


If you only knew
What I've been going through
Waiting and wanting you
Could this be love 
Oh, tell me could this be love 
Could this be love 
Top to bottom
Now it's perfection
Now he 
Fits my description
Swag delicion, most specticious
How he g-g-g-g-get them
And I want him 
Countdown baby, Imma get it

Pre Chorus:
Gonna take off when I hear start start
Run the red light, when we lock eyes, I...
Gonna go down, when I countdown
He already know, ready set go go go go

Chorus:
10 I was bout to leave
9 But your right on time
8 Baby please don't wait
7, 6, 5
5 He came through the door
4 And then crossed the floor
3 Eyes on me
2 This is what he said, you're the 11
Baby you're the 1 you're the 11
This is what he said, you're the 11
Baby you're the 1 you're the 11
This is what he said

Baby, me atrapas, me enloqueces
Con tu cuerpo me tienes
Justo en el punto que quieres
Donde el alma se pierde
Baby, dime lo que piensas
Me estoy dando cuenta
Eso que est s provocando
Yo s  muy bien lo que est s pensando


Ahora sabes lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Me vuelvo loco con tu cruel movimiento
Como quisiera con mis labios tocarte
Acariciarte, seducirte y amarte
Oh, baby, please

Dame, dame, dame, quiero sentir
Dame, dame, dame, todo de ti
Quiero, quiero, quiero
Perderme en tu pasi n y tu deseo
Dame, dame, dame, quiero sentir
Dame, dame, dame, todo de ti
Quiero, quiero, quiero
Perderme en tu pasi n y tu deseo


Me llamas
Me dices que me quieres
Y que me das la vida
Solo por tenerme
Te pido un poco m s de tu tiempo
No me ves que estoy muriendo
Tan solo por un beso
Es urgente tenerte en mis brazos
Sin ti me voy hundiendo despacio


Ahora sabes lo que yo estoy sintiendo
Me vuelvo loco con tu cruel movimiento
Como quisiera con mis labios tocarte
Acariciarte, seducirte y amarte
Oh, baby, please

Dance, yes 
Love, next
Dance, yes 
Love, next


Shimmy shimmy ya, shimmy yam, shimmy yay
I'm a old dirty dog all day, no way, Jos 
Your girl only go one way 
You should check that out
Maybe you won't turn her out
Maybe it's none of my business
But for now, work it out
Let's get this, dale

]
Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid
So why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby

So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

None
Redone, J.Lo


Nobody knows what I'm feeling inside
I find it so stupid, so why should I hide
That I love to make love to you, baby 
So many ways, wanna touch you tonight
I'm a big girl, got no secrets this time
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby


If this would be a perfect world
We'd be together then

Only got just one life, this I've learned
Who cares what they're gonna say 



I wanna dance, and love
And dance again
I wanna dance, and love
And dance again


Baby, your fire is lighting me up
The way that you move, boy, it's reason enough
That I love to make love to you, baby
I can't behave, oh, I want you so much
Your lips taste like heaven, so why should I stop 
Yeah, I love to make love to you, baby

Come on
Faster
Now if you could just walk in
Dance
Haha


Too much is on your mind, gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time, just let it flow
You say you need a break, there's nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you


Baby, what's this you tell me 
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It's gonna be alright, so let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind


Dance the night away 
Party 'til the sun comes up 
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance 
Dance 
Dance  with me
DJ, if you please

Come on
Faster
Now if you could just walk in
Dance
Haha


Too much is on your mind, gotta let it go
Can't worry all the time, just let it flow
You say you need a break, there s nothing I can do
Sitting here listening to you


Baby, what's this you tell me 
Things ain't been going your way, just take it from me
It s gonna be alright, so let's go out tonight
And we can leave all our cares behind

Party 'til the sun comes up 
Go grab a friend, get on the floor
Come on and dance 
Dance 
Dance  with me
DJ, if you please

You're perfect


I just can't control myself
I can't be with no one else
It seems I'm addicted to the way you like to touch me
I don't think they understand
Why I love at your command
From the words you speak
So deep our bodies meet, I had to have you


I love you, you're perfect
A manifestation of my dreams
You make my body feel
About a million different things


I think God made you for me
A mix of passionate fidelities
Baby, you're so complete
I write this song to let you know
That you will always be to me
My lust, my love, my man, my child, my friend, and my king

Bu tive chance di aman
Di dam valor e atencao
Mas bu ka foi capaz
Nha coracao sta maguado
Nu fika djunto muito tempo
Nunka bu dam carinho
E gossi li bu ta bem flam
Ma bu sa ta aman bu cre volta


Pre mas deixam
Deixam splikau
Kuse ki bu foi pa mi
Bu tem ki sabi
Mas deixam
Deixam ta splikau
Bu foi ero di nha vida
M'ka kre mas nao


Deixam em paz
Ka bu liga mas pa mi
Mi tambe m'kre ser feliz
Deixam em paz
Ka bu liga mas pa mi
Mi tambe m'kre ser feliz



Dime que me esperas
Dime que tus besos siguen teniendo el sabor
De una ma ana en primavera
Y que aun no hay maner

De que tu mirada se declare encarcelada
Y no se escape pasajera
Y si yo no traigo llaves
Me recibas en la puerta
Y me digas hoy que siempre estuvo abierta


Yo volver a a equivocarme una vez m s
Yo volver a a ti, ayer, atr s
Me quedar a si todav a me creyeras
Volver , volver 
Si me dices que me esperas
Volver , volver 


Dime que me esperas
Dime que las horas y minutos
Que cont  pens ndote no han sido en vano
D jame explicarte
Que para volver a amar de nuevo
Me hizo falta desprenderme de tu mano

If you think it's a joke, go 'head and laugh
Created my own lane, created my path
Graduated at high school, just not with my class
I'm like Einstein, I created my math
Hated algebra, but I loved to multiply
So I took my letters and made 'em numbers, right 
Will you evaluate  Jennifer, baby, let's celebrate

Now it's time to celebrate
I done had a long week
Now it's time to celebrate
This drink's for you

This is for my singles ladies and single mothers
Raising babies, working hard
I know the feeling, I used to live it
My mother worked two to three jobs
That's what this song is dedicated
To all the women out there, motivated
Always finding ways to make ends meet
All my women out there, innovative
You name the game, and they've played it
They've heard all the stories, so save it
All my women with power, meet me at happy hour
Let's celebrate

I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"


I came to dance, dance, dance, dance
I hit the floor 'cause that's my plans, plans, plans, plans
I'm wearing all my favorite brands, brands, brands, brands
Give me space for both my hands, hands, hands, hands

Yeah, yeah
'Cause it goes on and on and on
And it goes on and on and on
Yeah!


I throw my hands up in the air sometimes
Saying "Ayo! Gotta let go!"
I wanna celebrate and live my life
Saying "Ayo! Baby, let's go!"

As  se puede, amor
Un mundo enano, enano
Estamos mano a mano
Solo hace falta el amor
Se puede, amor


Yo quiero que este sea el mundo que conteste
Del Este hasta Oeste
Y bajo el mismo sol
Ahora nos vamos
Si juntos celebramos
Aqu  todos estamos bajo el mismo sol
Bajo el mismo sol
Dame, dame, d melo
Bajo el mismo sol


 Qu  pasa, J. Lo 
Saca lo malo, malo

Vale la pena mi amor, la pena mi amor
No hay fronteras, ver s
Ser  lo que t  quieras
Lo que t  quieras, amor
Se puede, amor

It's getting louder, louder
Mi gente scream and shout it
As  se puede amor

The vibe is so erotic
Solo hace falta el amor
Se puede amor


The celebration, no matter where you came from
We're all under the same sun
Y bajo el mismo sol
No shame, no hatin'
Uniting every nation

Bajo el mismo sol
Dame, dame, d melo
Bajo el mismo sol

 Qu  pasa J. Lo 
Want you to take it, take it

Don't want no space between us
Lo que t  quieras amor
Se puede amor



The celebration, no matter where you came from
We're all under the same sun
Y bajo el mismo sol
No shame, no hatin'
Uniting every nation
We're all under the same sun
Y bajo el mismo sol


Bajo el mismo sol
V monos
Todo-todo el mundo
Bajo el mismo sol




Se quebr  la calma
Y el silencio en ruido se volvi 


Quedaron desnudos
Nuestra imagen y nuestro dolor


Se mezclaba el cielo

Junto con la calle y el rencor


Nos llen  de miedo


D nde fue el amor


Dime si el dolor despierta el alma


Dime si es capaz de despertar el coraz n


Ni todo el rencor, ni la venganza


Nos va a poder calmar las ganas
De ver de nuevo aquellas caras


Dime si el dolor abre una puerta


Dime si es capaz de despertar el coraz n

Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad


You say that you gon' take my heart, bae
But I don't believe in fairytales
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed
You playing games, playing games
Now I'm taking names, taking names now
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over


Broke your heart so you could feel it
Think we're done, I think we're really through
Me and you 
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining
Sorrow, I can feel the pain in you
All in you 


Someone took my emotions
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask
Someone took my emotions
I feel good 'cause I don't feel bad
Que extra a sensaci n

Tu magia me envolvi 

Contigo perd a la f  y el control

Fui tu voluntad, tu debilidad

Y tu mi obsesi n

Me deje llevar por un beso mas

Perd  la raz n



Es amor que s  yo

La locura y el deseo

Es amor d melo

Este fuego tan intenso



Escap monos tan lejos de aqu 
Distantes de todo
En la oscuridad donde no haya m s
Que ver en tus ojos


Escond monos de la multitud
Del absurdo d a a d a
Donde todas esas cosas que perturben
No est n m s en nuestras vidas, en nuestras vidas


Para que estemos solos amor
Y el universo se nos quede en un abrazo
Donde se esfumen esas dudas
Y esos miedos que nos quedan del pasado


Para que estemos solos amor
En un d a sin fin
Sin preocuparnos m s
Del que podr n decir
Donde durmamos abrazados
Y si entonces nos sorprende el amanecer
Saber que est s ah 
Que estamos solos
None
Let's play a game
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan
Act like I'm interested in some other man, man, man
Turn on the lights 
So that the cameras flashing won't be so bright 
Ain't like the crowd ain't getting big outside 
They're wanting details on how I live my life, my life, my life


There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain

Can you love somebody loved by everybody 
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl 
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl 
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl 


Out through the back 
Too many people blocking the front door
We go our different ways, oh, we want more
Another gig I got don't end 'til four, four, four


There's no escape from the fame
To somewhere they don't know my name
I love you, I do feel your pain
But the question still remain


Can you love somebody loved by everybody 
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl 
Somebody loved by everybody
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl 
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl  
Can you love a girl  Can you love a girl

You know that our bodies were made for sinning

Oh baby, the room stars spinning
I think the floors about to meet me
Every single time you step on me
Oh baby, it's beyond butterflies now
It's more like I'm mesmerized now
Can't stay relaxed when you look in my eyes
Ain't even got to whisper
And my knees get weak
Don't let me see you coming
I'll forget how to speak
And baby, when you're near me
I can't even think
It's like I, oh, I think I...


I'm about to ooh ooh ooh ooh faint, baby
When I fall, when I see you, can't stand up straight
When I touch you, ohh baby ooh ooh ooh ooooh faint, baby
When you do the things you do, you make me wanna
Think I'm gonna faint


Oh baby, when we getting close
Got a feeling I already know
Ooh, every single time I'm ready to hit the floor
Come and catch me, before I am down
Three, two, and you know I'm out
I'm trying to calm down
What you do to me when you're around
Don't got to whisper
And my knees get weak
Don't let me see you coming
I'll forget how to speak
And baby, when you're near me
I can't even think
It's like I, oh I, think I...

I used to think you ever leave me, I'd slice my wrist
Treat you like a bitch, never that 
You got beef, where my niggas at  
And the street's where I'm living at

Clitter clack, that's the sound of the Mini Mack
Where we at  Uptown where it's really at
Give me that, I want the mansion and yacht 
Advance on the spot, we can dance 'til we drop
Am I handsome or not  
Jenny, you the bomb
Any man disrespect, good as gone


When I opened up my eyes today
Felt the sun shining on my face
It became so clear to me that everything is going my way
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see
Got rid of fears that were holding me
My endless possibility has the whole world opened for me
That's why...


I'm feeling so good 
I knew that I would 
Been taking care of myself like I should 
'Cause I don't think anyone can bring me down 
Nothing in this world's gon' turn me around


Now the day is turning into night
And everything is still going right
There's no way you can stop me this time
Or break this spirit of mine, oh, no
Like the stars above, I'm gonna shine
Anything I want will be mine
Tonight, I'm gonna have a good time
Call a few friends of mine
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

Damn you look good

Here I go, here I go
Feel better now, feel better now
Here I go, here I go
It's better now, feel better now


Do you remember when we fell under
Did you expect me to reason with thunder
I still remember when time was frozen
What seemed forever was just a moment

Hurry up, hurry up
There's no more waiting
We're still worth saving


Feel the light
Shining in the dark of night
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back
Feel the light
Shining like the stars tonight
Remember what we forgot
I know it's a long shot
But we're bringing it all back
We're bringing it all back


Here I go, here I go
Feel better now, feel better now
Here I go, here I go
It's better now, feel better now


I still remember when things were broken
But put together the cracks we'll close in

Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


See I know a little bit something good
Always comes out of a little bit something bad
And I wasn't looking for someone new 'til you came down
Giving me the best that I've had

And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out 
Yeah, you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round


Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I wish you were my first love 
'Cause if you were my first, baby
There would have been no second, third, or fourth love
Oh-oh-oh-oh, I


Mistakes, I don't worry 'bout them no more
It ain't nothing, 'cause you got me up on Cloud 9
So good, knowing I could just keep it real, t-shirt and jeans
See you making me feel so fly


And now you're on my skin
Body-to-body, working me out 
Yeah, you, you play to win
Rocking me steady, round after round

Baby, the way that I'm working my body
Can tell that you already like it
I'll make you lose your cabeza, go, loca 
Baby, we don't even need any music
'Cause we make the beat when we movin'
You know that it's making me hot, hot, hot  
We belong to the night
We belong to the music
So let's live in the moment
The freedom let it get you wild 


Let's ignite this fire up 
Across the world we take it up 
Let me hear you screaming out loud



When I say "go", when I say "viva" 
We'll take it low, let's lose control
When I say "go", we getting louder
Let's make it blow, let's lose control, so 
Follow the leader, follow the leader
I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya
Follow my lead, ah, follow my lead, ah
I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya
Follow the leader, follow the leader
I wanna see ya, I wanna see ya 
Follow my lead, ah, follow my lead, ah
I wanna see ya , I wanna see ya 

Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever, oh
Oh, forever 
Forever


You could stop the clock, that wouldn't be time enough
You could let the night turn to morning
I still would be wanting more of your love
There just ain't enough days in a week 
Weeks in a month , months in a year
How can I make it clear 

 I wanna be with you
 And feel the heat with you
 I'm floating in the distance
 I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will


Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
Don't let it be over tonight, over tonight
Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me
If it feels like this, it's gotta be right
Let's do it forever, we could do it forever
I could do this forever, I could do this forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever


Give me all your life, and I'd ask you for even more
You can't offer me a part of your body
'Cause honestly , it's just not enough anymore
Let's get lost in the moment
You know you want it, what you waiting for 


 I wanna be with you
 And feel the heat with you
 I'm floating in the distance
 I'm gonna stop the hands of time, I will
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Love has done a number on my mind
Though I sit and wonder, I don't ask why
Some decisions I've made haven't altogether been mine
Now I don't feel a thing, I feel more pain


No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair


What can I say about love 
I know what it means to have too little and too much
Crowding my thoughts
What I really want is to not think about it at all
Not think about it at all


Life is never easy when you need it to be
Desire can deceive you, it's better to daydream
Somewhere deep down inside, I knew it wasn't the right thing
But I didn't want to be wrong, that's a chance you take


No, I'm not bitter, I'm not cold
I'm just frozen for a moment
My vision is impaired
My heart is under repair

Jennifer 
Okay, okay
Wait
Roll again 
Wait


Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press the whine
And what can I say  I'm feeling you

He's a legend in the making
This voice is the blame to fame
His rhythm is similar to basketball
The way he shakes and he fakes and he takes some more
With everything he does, makes me feel his love
When the DJ plays this song and we all sing along
Up in the club with our hands in the air and it's all because
He's a poet, if the world doesn't say it, I hope that he knows it
This is for Chris, big up to Nas, this is for Biggie, of course
Shout out to Brooklyn, and here's to the Bronx where it all begin


Get on the mic, you know it'll ease your mind
Get on the mic, boy, I love you long time
Get on the mic, you make me feel so blind
The way you fill your mind, you know I press rewind
And what can I say  I'm feeling you


When I was growing up in the Boogietown
Hoping that music would be my faith
Looking for a way to escape
Recording the radio, took a set tape
They all sold to the UMC's
Snoop Dogg, Andre and now it's 50
All day, every day
'Cause MC's, they make me feel a special way 
Down south and your families
Back up to Bone Thugs N' Harmony
And I can't forget the ladies
Oh no, the ladies, knowing you crazy
'Lil Kim, Queen Latifah, you the queen
Salt N Pepa, Mary J. and Eve

Tripping  a little more than I should be

Your lips talking 'bout I, "Play too much"
Can't a woman take advantage of what she wants 
My hips moving, oh, so slow 
Bar tab looking like a car note 
All I need is you here right by my side 
Take whatever you want, baby, let's ride 
And whatever you won't do, let me decide
Just put your name on the dotted line


I'm about to sign you up, we can get right

Where would I be without you, honey 
Baby I'm me, all because I love you
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls
Are nothing without your loving
Although you might hear that in every love song
It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in everyway I can think of
And this is what I mean love


When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me
And darling, you are fi-i-ine
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine
'Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest, the best
You're the highest, the greatest part of me


I said you're the shhh and here's my proclamation
My way of saying thank you for your dedication
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine
And all because I know I'm your lady
And no, don't nothing get better than this, we steady stacking chips together
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other
No other can do-do what you do, 'cause baby you're the truth and that's why I gotta tell you that...

None
Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start
Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb
Cus they can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too
Ooh hands
Hands
Woooo hands
Oh hands
Cause they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands
None"Heart and soul
Psike!!"

It's like a song you know
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along
Oh, oh
In your heart and soul
You wanna sing along

I am nobody talking 'bout nothing
I am nothing in comparison, to what I feel
When I open my eyes, to what is real in the life
I know it take sacrifice, you can compromise
But now I realize

Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting, but am I wanting too much 
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right


We have everything, maybe it's nothing
But we know that there something
And I try to hold on
But it keeps escaping me
I know that I love you, but lately
Baby, something's missing
You're making me
Obsessive to the point that I'm rapidly changing
Can't take it we, try to be together when blatantly
This is not working mistakenly
We look so perfect, but everything
Ain't what it seems especially when


Heart and soul are looking for something
Keep on wanting
But am I wanting too much 
It is too much for you to be
Here for me
All or nothing; that is the question
Love will always seem to find
Something true to make it right

I know better than anybody how it feels
To want somebody so bad after you break up
Still looking for that phone call
Still, even when they don't call
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over
Act like you wasn't listening when they told you
They don't want to be with you anymore
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore


'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

He'll be back to make up for the lonely days
He'll be back when things ain't working out his way
He'll be back when he sees that it's not the same
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back
He knows he's gonna need his lady
He'll be back when his boys say he must be crazy
He'll be back, he'll know he made a big mistake
He'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back, he'll be back


You don't want to believe it but you see it happening
Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having
Still looking for his return
Still hoping that he's gonna learn
Wake up, and realize the truth
Make some time for you
What is he trying to do to you 
Miss him more as days go by
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive


'Cause in your mind, you're still together
Thought it would last, but there's no forever
Walked out on you with no call, no letter
When he realize it don't get no better

Mafia


You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it

Every time I try to run something keeps stopping me

I try my best to turn around
But your touch won't let me leave

Ah, uh, I can't control it
You put something inside of me, ooh, ooh
Uh, 'cause you're a problem
Boy, you must have poisoned me, oh-oh


You don't know what you're doing
What you're doing to me
Try to stop it, can't stop it
'Cause you got what I need
You got me all open, and I ain't trying to leave
Hold it, don't drop it, don't drop it
Stop it, can't stop it, won't stop it


Boy, I must be buggin'
Let you play those games I don't understand

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me
And call me baby  


We're stacking down trust issues

And I know I'm the jealous type, yeah
But you're tip-toeing every night, yeah
For a night, let's be eye-to-eye
Bottle wine, losing track of time, yeah


No one needs the complication
One touch, tell me where we stand
You and me, the right equation
Won't you tell me now 
So lost in interpretation
One touch, tell me where we stand
Are we past infatuation

See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams

If you really want me, baby

Aha
Right here, it's another Darkchild collab, you know 
Something that you can lean to
Something that you can ride to
Something that you can step to, you know 
We back
Uh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh, uh, uh


Sometimes real love can be
Not seen 'cause you're thinking
What's right in front of you can't be the one for you
Then one day you realize that
There are feelings that you can't hold back
And you're so caught up, now that's all you think of
Crazy how


All that talk of us not able to last 
Just because of mistakes we made in the past
But they fail to understand


I got you and nobody can come and change a thing
'Cause you gotta know you got me
And it feels so good to have your back now
I'm so proud I've got you
And if somebody tries to take you from me
They will see I've got you
You got me, I got you
None
I love
Boy, I love you so
I love


You and I have been around each other for quite a while
But I don't think that you understand the way that I feel for you
Baby, it took a while for me, yeah, yeah, to realize that you were so naive
Well maybe you were blind and cannot see
The feelings I have for you, you don't understand
The things that I've gone through
To paint a perfect picture just for you 
I've even told your friends, but that won't do
Well, baby, you have to know, I can't wait no more


 Love you more than you will ever know
 I've been trying so hard to show you
 Love you like a queen would love her king
 Baby, I've been trying to show you


Look at me, try to understand that I am here for you
And whatever you are going through no matter what you ask me to do I will do
See baby, I'm trying to make you see 
This is not pretend or make believe 
I want to be the woman that you need
Just let me get close to you, take me in your heart
Every day I want you more and more 
Never in my life was I so sure 
These feelings I have I can't ignore
So baby, just let me know, all I'm trying to say is
None
My heart belongs to you
So what could I do
To make you feel I'm down with
You see me hangin' around
But you don't know how you make me feel for you, and



I try to make some sense of this

I know it could be serious

I dream about just holding you

What is a girl supposed to do 

I love you 
I want you 
You're the one that I live for
And I can't take it anymore 
I love you 
I need you 
What can I do to make you see
You're the only one for me


First time I saw your face
My heart just erased
All the guys I knew
Before you walked into my life
I was the type to never want for nothing



I try to make some sense of this

I know it could be serious

I dream about just holding you

What is a girl supposed to do

Is her number in your phone 
And your answer's yes and yes
But you still say no and no
Even though I know you know
I know I know you know I know
You know  It sound dumb-de-dumb-dumb
They say what we want's wrong, fuck it

And even though your makeup smears

Oh, yes
Yes, I did, baby
Yes, I did


It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right
Don't you know he's not for you 
I always knew what I had to do
But it's hard to get away
'Cause I love you, I just tried to stay

I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And I know inside I'ma be alright 
I said I couldn't do it but I did it 
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it 
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it
And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright


Friends of mine say to me
Say you got control over me
You're not alone, I played my part
I saw the way you were from the start
Could I expect so much from you 
You had a girl when I first met you
Did the best that you could do
Now I realize that I can't change you


I used to say I couldn't do it but I did it

And that voice inside says I'm gonna be alright
]
Oh yes



Yo, I took you from the projects, put the best clothes in ya closet
Like Ginger from "Casino" and now you a pro
We was like Joe DiMaggio and Marilyn Monroe
All ya jealous girlfriends hatin' waitin'
So I put the cards in yo' hand
All I know, when Nas was yo' man
It was so real, boats and sixes
Special Japanese chefs makin' home cooked dishes
Plenty trips, invisible sets
You know what you missin'

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile
But deep inside, I could hear
Voices telling me this ain't right

Oh yes



I want to be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears 
The reason there's two karats in each your ears
I sperge with the paper, ma, I don't care
How you like the pumps, boots, Jeeps, coupes 
Make celebs, 50 fall off never
What's mines is yours and what's yours is mine
So when I shinin', you shine
Come on, the finest champagne, we can toast to life
Crap table in Vegas, you can toss the dice
Don't let your friends get you confused sayin' 50 bad news
I need you in my life, girl, you're too much to lose 

It's funny 'cause for a while
I walked around with a smile

So we can leave that old shit in the restroom
Young Money

You got me and I could not defend it
I tried, but I had to surrender
Your style got me under the spellbound
Let me no other choice but to get down


It's too late, it's too late

Listen, now I'm strong, baby, I bring the fire on
Sharpshooter, you can call me "The Zion"
I'm not the one easy to get to
But all that changed, baby, when I met you

What's my name
R-U-L-E
Blowing back on mary jane
And analyzin' the game
The game done chose me
To bring the words I can't say, it's one in the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I'll be makin' less room for you
Only God can hold me
Judge me, the only man that help is above me, holla


I've met so many men and
It's like they're all the same
My appetite for lovin'
Is now my hunger pain
And when I'm feelin' sexy
Who's gonna comfort me 
My only problem is
Their insecurities


Tired being alone 
Sick of arguin' on the phone 
Tellin' all your friends 
But your man don't understand my love

What's my name !
R-U-L-E
Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
And the name of the game, it's all one and the same
Ever since you told me
There's only room for two, I've been makin' less room for you
Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me
The only man that respects the one above me, holla


I met so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hunger pain

My only problem is their insecurity


Tired of being alone, yeah, yeah
Sick of arguing on the phone, yeah, yeah

Called you on the phone, said, "I'm comin through

R-U-L-E
Blowin' back on this Mary Jane, I'm analyzin' the game
And the game done chose me
To bring pain to pussy niggas & pussy hoes
They're one in the same
Ever since you told me

Now only God can hold me
Hug me, love me, judge me

'Cause I'm real

'Cause I'm real
And I can't go on without you


Girl, I've been thinkin' 'bout this relationship
And I wanna know is this as good as it gets 
'Cause we've been through the worst times and the best times
But it was our time, even if it was part-time
Now they been lookin' at me, smilin' at me
Laughin' like we wasn't happy
But not knowin' that we're growin' and we gettin' married
Hard lovin' and straight thuggin'
Bitch, I ain't doin' this shit for nothing
I'm here to get it poppin', hop in', let's ride up in the Benz
Hair blowin' in the wind, sun glistenin' off my skin, hey
I'm nasty, heh, you know me
But you still don't fuck with your baby
]
Now only God can hold me



I've seen so many men and it's like they're all the same
My appetite for loving is now my hungers pain
And when I'm feeling sexy who's gonna comfort me
My only problem is their insecurities


Tell me who is that girl, standing cross the way
She like what I got, got, got, watch her become my slave
Baby girl it's me, yeah that crazy nigga Nate
I won't 'lax so don't talk back let's be on our way



You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me go "baby, baby," cause you're a sexy girl
You make me...


Now people loving me, and hating me, treating me ungratefully
But not knowing that they ain't making or breaking me
My life I live is to the limit and I love it
Now I can breathe again, baby, now I can breathe again

Ah, haha, yeah, ye-yeah, yeah


You're afraid but give it time
There's got to be something you like
Love letters but no replies
Boy, you've got to know what you want


From the way you look at me
Friends checking me 
Always whispering
Never confront me 
Think that I'm gonna let you know
That's no time for playing no more

Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me 
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me 
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting


It's okay, don't be shy
Because you might find love in the first try
Now you know I can't read your mind
You got to let me know what you want


From the way you look at me
Friends checking me 
Always whispering
Never confront me 
Think that I'm going to let you know
That's no time for playing no more


Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me 
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting
Even though you got me wondering
And you need to tell me something
How you feel about me 
And if this love is ever gon' be, I'm waiting

Uh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh


This is where my story begins
Standing here with you, I'm about to give in
And I'ma give all I can give
Even though in previous relationships
I might have been mischievous
I wasn't always ready, I admit to this
But what a good feeling it is
I've had a lot of crushes, close to nothing like this 


And every time the subject would come up 
I made up every excuse that I could think of 
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up
In a few words, this feeling, I could sum up


I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
Wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting
I need love
For the first time in my life, I need love
Ain't no love up in the club, I need love
I wanna cuddle up to someone
That make me feel like I'm something
Getting sick and tired of fronting, I need
Unreleased
If you love me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body


Sweet little white lies
Your sweet little white lies
Leave a bad taste in my mouth
Your taste in my mouth 
Queen in the night time
Black dress with white wine
Mess it up, watch it fall down
When you watch it fall down


You tell me I'm a real one, I'm the right one
But only when you're on one
You tell me that you need me, wanna see me
But only when you want some, want some


Yeah, if you lov  me
Say it in the morning
Not just in the  vening
Only when you want my body, want my body
Baby, love me like you mean it
Not just in the evening
Only when you want my body, want my body

It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah
I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah
I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind


Can't decide, can't define what I feel inside
It's still bad, it's still good, prefer and love
It's a rush, it's so rough, this is out of line
It's a storm and it rock, rock, rocks my boat

My destiny, misery, your energy


It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind


Like a wild wrecking ball, crashing block-by-block
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls
Freezing cold, steaming hot, sweaty drip-drip-drop
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it off


My destiny, misery, your energy


It's invading my mind and breaking the ice, woah, I can't fight it
This feeling's invading my, my mind
I'm infected tonight, woah, I can't fight it
It's taking, invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
This feeling's invading my, my mind
My mind, my mind
It's taking, invading my, my mind

Na na na na na
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
Oh, oh


It's not that serious
I never put that much thought into us
It wasn't that I loved you, I was curious
Who did you think that you were involved with 
Now, baby, you should know it's not that serious


How could you tell me that you love me
When I knew you were just tryna play me 
But you're the fool because I know how to switch the game up on you
And in the end, I know who will lose


I played this game before 
And I can't play no more 
What do you take me for  
It's not what you thought 
So don't play games with me 
'Cause I came to teach 
And if you want to cheat 
It won't be with me 

I've been


All I need is a place to be and a way to feel
A space to figure out where I belong
A chance to know my thoughts and find a way to show
What I feel and if this is real, yeah


Don't wanna disappoint you
Don't wanna let you down
'Cause that's the last thing I would do
I'm asking for your patience
I realize I could lose you
But lately, I've been so confused


I've been thinkin' 
You've been on my mind 
So I've been praying 
To find a way that I 
Can be sure, the way that 
You've been sure with me 
Don't you want that for me 
None

You mad or you jealous, you sad or you settle
The brighter the rainbow, the badder the weather
The good with the bad, but the badder the better
Bring my sand to the beach, nigga, and to the desert
We fell from the heavens, we landed like feathers
The rose in the rubble, keep your nose out our petals
Your hoes know my schedule, and my hoes know I'm special
They know not to question, bitch, you know I'm not Alexa
She, she post a pic of me and her from off her iPad
You know them hoes don't like that, where the likes at 
Jealousy is a disease, you can die mad

If the day comes that you must leave
Let me be the ground to your feet
If the day comes that you feel weak
Let me be the armor you need


Oh, if falling in love is a crime
And the price to pay is my life
Give me the sword, bring all the knives
Hand me the gun, I will not run
And when they spare everything but my pride
Don't you worry, boy, don't you cry
But when they ask who was the one
Who did you love 
Let it be me


If you ever meet your last breath
Let me be the last word you say
And if right comes, but you choose left
I will be the first to forgive


Oh, if Heaven is a beautiful place
But those gates don't have enough space
And they lock you out, spare you no flame
I will come down there on my wings
And when the angels call me a fool
For giving all my grace up for you
I won't look back, but when they ask
Who did you love 
Let it be me

Como un dulce con caramelo
Necesitaba un amor del bueno
Llegaste
Dijiste pues claro "te quiero"
Para enamorarse no hay tiempo
Necesitaba un amor del bueno
Ahora que perdono mis errores puedo ver todo m s claro
Ahora que el silencio me acaricia y se fue la soledad
Llegas con una sonrisa puesta, iluminas mis espacios
T  llegas y me dices al o do "qu date una noche m s"


 Qui n creer a que t  llegar as como acto de magia

I am the love of, the love of my life
I ain't got nobody else on my mind
I am the love of, the love of my life

All my life praying for you, praying for you, praying for you
All that I wanted was someone to come and sit up on my table for two
I was just waiting for you 
Don't know how I fell and don't know why, don't know why
And now I'll pick myself up one more time, one more time

Would you mind if I took the time to get to know you 
'Cause it's been a while since all we've been through
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change
Nothing stays the same, ooh
I could see when I look in your eyes, you mean no harm
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong
And there ain't nothing wrong with me still loving you


After all that we've been through 
I find myself still loving you 
But I think we need to take the time to get back
'Cause I never get up on a good thing
I never give up on the love we had 
We just need to take it slow


In the past, you would act as if you don't really care
You would fight and argue almost anywhere
Looking back sometimes, I feel like such a fool
For putting up with you, boo
Baby, please understand me if it seems I'm confused
It's just it might take me some time to get used to you
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby
I just find myself still loving you

Ahora si te echo de menos
Ahora que si me lo creo
Me duele vivir y pensar que elegi
En vez del cielo el infierno
Que si se extranan tus besos
Que si me muero por dentro
Me alejo de ti hacia la obscuridad
Y en el fango me encuentro


La verdad estoy mal
El sufrir, es gritar


Si me haces falta
T  me haces falta
Si te recuerdo, te extrano, te siento en el alma
Si me haces falta
T  me haces falta
Si me arrepiento, me odio, estoy desesperada


Desesperada, estoy aqu  desesperada
Ahora si te echo de menos
Ahora si estoy hecha menos
Ahora si puedo sentir toda la soledad
Que tanto y tanta   da miedo
Que si te extra o te pienso
Que si el dolor es intenso
El sobrevivir de la batalla final
Es cruzar el desierto



Ah, ah
'Tamo listas de pies a cabeza, salimo' a la calle, salimo' por ti
Son las doce, pero Cenicienta dej  el celular, hoy no se va a dormir
'Tamo dura', dura', freaky, freaky, los diente' afila'o parecen de marfil
'Tamo listas de pies a cabeza y salimo' a la calle, salimo' a partir 


La luna llena 't  ready para m  
Si t  te quedas, lo tienes todo aqu  

Y si nos vamo' pa' Miami
Todo lo tuyo es pa' m , todo lo m o es pa' ti 
Y si nos vamo' pa' Miami
Todo lo tuyo es pa' m , todo lo m o es pa' ti 


Playa, fiesta y alcohol 
Ah  es que prende el motor 
Estar contigo es un doll
T  rompo en la ciudad del sol 
Un temblor , d scontrol 
Qu  linda te ves ba ada en sudor 
La nota sube como ascensor 
Y ella aprieta el acelerador


To'a la noche hasta al otro d a contigo vacilando 
Y guayando 
Este party no se acaba, doce de la madrugada y bailando
T  y yo rozando 


La luna llena 't  ready para m 
Si t  te quedas, lo tienes todo aqu 

Strangers always got some mess to spread
But I have learned to flick them off 
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs
I strap 'em on and I walk it off 


Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy 
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe 

Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes


My strut's so fierce
Steven's got 'em mad at me
Laugh and talk behind my back
But they'll never get the best of me
I see 'em doing my dance
And I hear 'em singing my song
I'm surpassing the rest
'Cause that's how I was raised to do it


Got 'em saying, "I can't believe she did it
No, she didn't"
My "wow" factor's got 'em crazy 
Got 'em saying, "Yeah, she did it
But I can't believe it"
Never say you can't believe 


Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes
Even if they try
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes
They couldn't even lace 'em up right
Honey, these pumps are too big to fill
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes



Ahora respiro y me recupero
Que mucho me ha costado vestirme con todo y sombrero
Y siento que el viento ya me da en la cara
Recuerdo que puedo ir so ando y detener ma ana
Y apareces sin aviso
Como sol as hacerlo antes
Te escucho y te siento
Perderlo en silencio


Tan solo m rame
Buscando un atajo para volver a mirarte
Diciendo el mismo libreto que alg n d a te cont 
Busc ndome
Tan solo m rame
Pensando que todo fue f cil, s lo m rate
Creyendo que yo no soy fr gil, s lo m rame
Llor ndote, sabiendo que ya es tarde


Preguntas que pienso de cada palabra
T  crees que ya no duermo
Si sabes que yo te esperaba
Pero se te paso el invierno
Calleron hojas en mi pecho
Me fueron sanando
Y as  te fui olvidando

We live
We love
We die


She called me up late at night
We commit innocent crime
She's such a good waste of time
But in the back of my mind
You know you're all I'm thinking of
You know you're all I'm thinking of


I can't catch a single breath, baby
Help me now, help me now
Hurry up, it's killing me
The way I need your mouth to mouth mouth to mouth
I can't catch a single breath, baby
Help me now, help me now
Hurry up, it's killing me
The way I need you mouth to mouth
Mouth to mouth


Kills me to let him inside
Feels like the wrong kind of right
He falls asleep by my side
But in the back of my mind
You know you're all I'm thinking of
You know you're all I'm thinking of

Well the sun goes up and the sun goes down
And it looks the same on both sides of town

Yeah I give them a kiss and I tuck them in
And get ready for tomorrow and I do it all over again
And I'm worried that I'm feeling when I'm staring at the ceiling, yeah man
Be the same way you're feeling when you lay down tonight


My house is your house
Same dirty laundry, same dirty dishes
My house is your house
Air it all out and sort all the issues
I love to sing, I love to dance
We're making memories, we're making plans
With the same prayers, same hurt
Same love, same worth
The places we come from may feel so distant
But we're really not that different




We hang on the bush, we hang on the stoop
My boys shooting deer, our boys shooting hoops
It's in the way we live, it's in the way we talk
I'm Jenny from the dirt road, I'm Jenny from the block

And I struggle through the day thinking there's no way
I'm gonna make it through this
And I say to myself "Baby no te preocupes"
No don't you worry

Forgiving him was the first thing I had to to
In order to move on
Forgetting it was not as easy to do
I had to teach myself to be strong
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good, sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving


It's so good, don't wanna hear no woulda coulda
Maybe I shoulda stayed with someone who never knew that I was true
It's all good now that I'm going forward
Now that I'm growing, now that I'm knowing


Never gonna give up on
Never gonna give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh
Never gonna give up, give up on love, oh-oh, oh-oh


I have to admit
You weren't the only one at fault
I was wrong too
Trying to be someone I knew that I wasn't
I thought I could make myself happy with you
And it's so easy to be scared
When I think of all that I shared
When I think of how he made me feel
The bad and the good
Sometimes I wish I could take it back
But we can't go back, gotta keep moving

I've been tossing and turning
Oh, this hunger is burning
I need something to feed my soul 
I race my thoughts to the morning
I got this need that's growing
Wake you up just to make me whole 


Your body is Heaven and it feels like home 
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go


I'm never satisfied
Honey, my appetite is keeping me up at night
I'm going crazy for more of your love
I need you all the time
You bring me back to life
I'm going crazy for more of your love


Craving hits every time I leave you
There ain't nothing else I can do
I'll follow anywhere you go 


Your body is Heaven and it feels like home 
And those sweet lips, I can never let you go



 Gente de Zona!
Lo mejor que suena ahora
JLo


Como en la vida, el amor es as 
Nace de la nada y se convierte en todo
Nunca imagin  enamorarme as 
No ten as previsto sentir amor


El amor es as 
Inspirador, cautivador
Conmovedor, provocador
Y a veces tentaci n
El amor es as 
Controlador, es dictador
Emocionante, apasionante
Depredador


Ni t  ni yo, ni t  ni yo
Ay, le haremos caso a la gente
Ellos no saben lo que se siente
Cuando estamos juntos t  y yo
Ni t  ni yo, ni t  ni yo
Nos dimos cuenta de lo que hicimos
Y tu coraz n es testigo
Dime qu  fue lo que pas 
Ni t  ni yo, ni t  ni yo
Ni t  ni yo, ni t  ni yo
Tenemos el control
Ni t  ni yo, ni t  ni yo

Diamonds on the necklace, everything else is off
Now we wanna bet he can beat me to the bed, oh no
When no one's around we do some things, do it for pleasure
We hide from the night 'til morning light, feels like forever


Right here by the light of the moon
Spotlight on you got me zooming
I'm falling into you


We're dancing on tabletops, neighbors calling the cops
When I'm with you, feels like
Nobody's watching us
We're burning down all the clocks, hoping that time will stop
Lock out the world tonight
Like nobody's watching us
Nobody's watching us


No, nobody's watching
So come touch my body
No, nobody's watching us


Mmm, there could be a million people
But my eyes are only locked on you 
You got tunnel vision for me when I move
Putting on a show, that's what we do
And we don't sleep at night
Got adrenaline going through the bloodstream
Don't sleep at night, no, no 

Dime por qu  lloras
De felicidad
Y por qu  te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di por qu  me tomas, fuerte as , mis manos
Y tus pensamientos te van llevando
Yo te quiero tanto
Y por qu  ser 
Loco testarudo
No lo dudes m s
Aunque en el futuro
Haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme

No me ames
Porque pienses que
Parezco diferente
 T  no piensas que es lo justo
Ver pasar el tiempo juntos 
No me ames
Que comprendo la mentira que ser a
Si tu amor no merezco
No me ames
Mas qu date otro d a


No me ames
Porque estoy perdido
Porque cambi  el mundo
Porque es el destino
Porque no se puede
Somos un espejo
Y t  as  ser as lo que yo de m  reflejo
No me ames
Para estar muriendo
Dentro de una guerra llena de arrepentimientos
No me ames
Para estar en tierra
Quiero alzar el vuelo con tu gran amor
Por el azul del cielo

Dime porque lloras
De felicidad
Y porque te ahogas
Por la soledad
Di porque me tomas
Fuerte asi, mis manos
Y tus pensamientos
Te van llevando
Yo te querio tanto
Y porque sera
Loco testarudo
No lo dudes mas
Aunque en el futuro
Haya un muro enorme
Yo no tengo miedo
Quiero enamorarme
No me ames, porque pienses
Que parezco diferente
Tu no pienses ques es lo justo
Ver pasar el tiempo juntos
No me ames, que comprendo
La mentira que seria
Si tu amor merezco
No me ames, quedate otra dia
None
Stop! Put your hands in the air! Jack, I know you're up there!


Shit!


Where's Kenneth 


He's up here. He's dead

Come on, Jack. Don't


Pretend it's not me


You think I'd shoot you 


If you don't, somebody else will


Put the gun down


I'm not going back


Jack, please don't make me do this. Put the gun down


No more time outs
Hace dos a os y un d a que vivo sin  l
Hace dos a os y un d a que no lo he vuelto a ver
Y aunque no he sido feliz aprend  a vivir sin su amor
Pero al ir olvidando de pronto una noche volvi 
 Qui n es 


Soy yo


 Qu  vienes a buscar 

A ti


Ya es tarde


 Por qu  
Porque ahora soy yo la que quiere estar sin ti
Por eso vete, olvida mi nombre, mi cara, mi casa
Y pega la vuelta
Jam s te pude comprender
Vete, olvida mis ojos, mis manos, mis labios
Que no te desean


Est s mintiendo, ya lo s 


Vete, olvida que existo, que me conociste
Y no te sorprendas, olvida de todo que t  para eso
Tienes experiencia

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh


Took a shot with the bad boy from the block
And picked my love right from the start
Mister wrong, he plays his part
Back to the beginning, now round two
Try my luck with something new
We danced until we said "I do"
My luck is bad, no more us two
No me and you 

Is it too much to ask for a real love 
Something that'll last


Is there one love only once in a lifetime 
It's so hard to find the perfect one to call mine
Is there one love, somebody that compliments me
And makes me want to never leave 
Made just right for me
Is there one love  
One love 
One love 
One love 


It's take three, could there be a part for me 
Came and swept me off my feet
Went nowhere, but kept the ring
Once again, I'm lonely
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure
So worn out, but love just saw
Made me want to try once more
And I couldn't say no 


Is it too much to ask for a real love 
Something that'll last 

You must be thinking, how did I get here 
And I wonder if you've been here before
So many things I want to ask you and know about you
You seem like you are ready to run
Stand right up and walk out that door
Oh yes, you've been here before
But for this moment you're all mine
So let's just take it one step at a time


One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast

I would spend my lifetime wondering why
He chose me for you and you for I
You have things to teach me
I have a feeling inside
I have this vision of three of us
Holding hands
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky


One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast


How can three become one 
You're the greatest thing that I've ever done
I want to create a world
You will always want comeback to
And here's my wish for both of you




One step at a time
No need to rush
Let's keep this time for us
And make it lasts as long as we can
It's already going too fast



Always knew you even when I didn't know you
Don't make sense, but it do

Every teardrop fell so heavy
Hurt like hell, but Heaven sent me through

Every heartbreak was a yellow brick road
Pointin' me straight, just takin' me home

Tengo una vista al mar desde el balc n
Desayuno en la cama,  por qu  no , oh-oh
Tengo un closet full de Christian Dior
Obras de Picasso y hasta de Van Gogh, oh-oh


Tantos autos y diamantes

Got ocean views from ceiling to the floor
Keep a milli by the bed, a hundred more offshore-o-ore
Closets full of Louis and Christian Dior
Picasso's and Van Gogh's that no one's seen before-o-ore


Diamonds drippin' down like fountains
I'll sign, don't care what the amount is
Every day and night, live a life filled with luxury
Don't matter when you're not with me, yeah, yeah

Todo lo que tengo es pa' ti, pa' ti

Is this sentimental
To put all my money just right where my heart is 
But, baby, you're special
No matter the cost I'ma do it regardless
Let's take a jet, we're riding out to Puerto Rico
Later we get the yatch, head to Santo Domingo
And my body, papi, es tu party
Now I'm flying, you be the pilot
No questionin' our love, make my best days even better
Long ain't long enough, I'm looking at forever


Diamonds drippin' down like fountains

Every day and night, live a life filled with luxury

People, people who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
We're children, needing other children
And yet letting our grown-up pride
Hide all the need inside
Acting more like children, than children
Lovers are very special people
They re the luckiest people in the world
One person
One very special person
A feeling deep in your soul
Says you were half, now you're whole

No more hunger and thirst
But first, be a person who needs people
People who need people
Are the luckiest people in the world
You wanna dance
You wanna move
I'm on a mission to just take you to the moon
We like to party
We're in the mood
So turn it up and let the music get you loose


We're feeling high
Gimme that bass
Just get them drinks and put yo' hand up in the air
You know you want me
So make a move
Come over here and show me what you're gonna do


Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite
Tonight we're going all the way
You want my lips to kiss the pain away
Body to body, we can cause a flame
We can ignite, ignite, ignite
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical
We're gettin' physical, physical, physical, oh
Physical, physical

Uh
Yeah


I could wait all night and day
To go to a party, sit down and wait
Give my request to the DJ
'Cause my song, he's gotta play 
And when I hear that beat, I get my body up out my seat
I grab a guy and move my feet
He's playing my song

Baby relax, we've been waiting for this
And we deserve the heavenly bliss
That waits underneath the stars above
Can't you hear them begging us, "Let's make love" 
From the bottom of my heart I give you my soul
Right here in this room the truth unfold

Is saying , stop playing 
Delaying the divine


The pleasure is mine , let me give some to you
We can take our time , nothing I'd rather do 
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever 
Remember  the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine


Everyday I've been dreaming about how
It's gonna be to find you out
To be sharing your kiss, to be just like this
What I wouldn't do for a taste of your lips
So let's not waste one second more
Let's cut the lights and let's lock the door


Is saying , stop playing 
Delaying the divine


The pleasure is mine , let me give some to you 
We can take our time , nothing I'd rather do 
To make you feel fine, to make your life shine
Give you moments you can treasure forever 
Remember  the pleasure is mine
Mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine, mine, mine, all mine
The pleasure is mine



Por arriesgarlo todo amor
Por liberarnos y crecer
Por aventarnos y volar
Por eso y este gran amor
Y t  eres una bendici n
Por todo lo que es mi verdad
Y porque ahora somos dos
Las almas se pueden juntar
Y los esp ritus bailar, jugando a nuestro alrededor


Am monos despacio sin excusas que t  y yo quisimos
Ven detr s de m 
No queda nada m s que amarte y si en todo apareces t 
No queda nada m s que amarte, nada m s que amarte
Am monos despacio sin excusas que t  y yo quisimos
Ven detr s de m 
El alma estalla en mil pedazos si t  est s conmigo
Am monos


Y de tu mano aprender 
Que mis sentidos sean tu voz
A darte fuerza y no caer
A que mi hogar sea tu piel
Ya que tu vida es mi raz n
None


Tengo que enfrentarme a m  misma y ver la realidad
Entender que las estrellas por altas no se pueden tocar
Que la luz que iluminaba este sueno no se puede ver m s
Y el amor por m s enorme e intenso un dia puede acabar
Da miedo que, que te vayas
Y abandonar las cosas que no volver n
No volver n, jam s

Ahora  qu  puedo decir si ya no tengo palabras 
No necesito morir para entender que es por ti que se apaga mi alma
Ahora  qu  puedo decir si le converso a mi almohada 
Que estoy cansada de o r, de callar y esperar, de morderme las ganas
Reconozco tu espalda, como un cobarde te marchas


Ma ana cuando cruze' esa puerta, no te quiero ver m s
Y lleva en tus maletas las cosas que en mi vida no van
Y no creas que me quedo vencida para tu vanidad
Oh, por amor yo me he jugado la vida y me la vuelvo a jugar
Te juro que me haces falta
En todas esas cosas donde ya no est s
Y que ya no est n, jam s


Ahora  qu  puedo decir si ya no tengo palabras 
No necesito morir para entender que es por ti que se apaga mi alma
Ahora  qu  puedo decir si le converso a mi almohada 
Que estoy cansada de o r, de callar y esperar, de morderme las ganas
Reconozco tu espalda, como un cobarde te marchas
Ahora  qu  puedo decir si ya no tengo palabras 
No necesito morir para entender que es por ti que se apaga mi alma
Ahora  qu  puedo decir si le converso a mi almohada 
Que estoy cansada de o r, de callar y esperar, de morderme las ganas
Reconozco tu espalda, como un cobarde te marchas
La letra completa no est  disponible por el momento



 Es un aviso 
El reloj marca once once
 No es coincidencia 
Que esta noche hay luna llena

Por siempre los dos
Por siempre los dos
Por siempre los dos
Por siempre los dos


Feelin' you go on and touch my love
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us 
Could it be us  


Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be
Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be us 
Co-co-could it be


Feelin' you go on and touch my love 
Throwing it now, here you go, catch up
Could it be us 
Could it be us  

I know it's on your heart
That a love like ours shall never fall apart
You're so afraid of the rain
So I will take your hand
And I'll love you in the best way that I can
And I only expect the same


Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh

Though I am sure of what I feel
I never thought a love so true felt so unreal
And I'm a little afraid myself
But if you love me day by day
With an honest heart and just a little faith
Baby, time will tell the tale


Don't promise me forever
Don't promise me the sun and sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try


Oh, oh
Mmm


Don't promise me forever
Don't you promise me the sun and the sky
Don't pretend to know you'll never make me cry
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try, ooh
Just hold me now and promise me you'll try
Oh, oh
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby 
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby 


Like deja vu, seen it before
Ain't nothing new up under the sun
Don't take my kindness for gullible
Ain't nothing new, you can try to run
Give you your rope, don't hang yourself
Prove all my theories 'bout you wrong
Show up early, not an hour late
If you want my lovin', that last you long

One in a million, could you be that radiate 
'Cause that be shining right now
Can you be the 
Can wear you 'round my finger now 
Said you heat up my world
Can you be my global warmin' now  Oh


Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Put your lovin' where your mouth is
Hear you talkin' that shit, let me see it, baby 
Yeah, you makin' promises, better keep 'em, baby 
Oh, oh, oh
Show me you 'bout that bidness
Put your lovin' where your mouth is


You got my front, you got my back
Without anybody else on the side
Could you pick me up when I'm feeling low 
Balance me out when I get too high
Read my the realest, no matter what
Don't just tell me what I wanna hear
Show me the words that you always say
So that picture that you paintin' clear



Ayer los dos so  bamos con un mundo perfecto
Ayer a nuestros labios les sobraban las palabras
Porque en los ojos nos espi bamos el alma
Y la verdad no vacilaba en tu mirada
Ayer nos prometimos conquistar el mundo entero
Ayer t  me juraste que este amor ser a eterno
Porque una vez equivocarse es suficiente
Para aprender lo que es amar sinceramente

 Qu  hiciste 
Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para as  romperme el alma
 Qu  hiciste 
Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvid  que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa


Ma ana que amanezca un d a nuevo en mi universo
Ma ana no ver  tu nombre escrito entre mis versos
No escuchar  palabras de arrepentimiento
Ignorar  sin pena tu remordimiento
Ma ana olvidar  que ayer yo fui tu fiel amante
Ma ana ni siquiera habr  razones para odiarte
Yo borrar  todos tus sue os de mis sue os
Que el viento arrastre para siempre tus recuerdos


 Qu  hiciste 
Hoy destruiste con tu orgullo la esperanza
Hoy empa aste con tu furia mi mirada
Borraste toda nuestra historia con tu rabia
Y confundiste tanto amor que te entregaba
Con un permiso para as  romperme el alma
 Qu  hiciste 
Nos obligaste a destruir las madrugadas
Y nuestras noches las borraron tus palabras
Mis ilusiones acabaron con tus farsas
Se te olvid  que era el amor lo que importaba
Y con tus manos derrumbaste nuestra casa

Estoy
Loca
Enamorada
De ti

Hanging out the window busting at them love haters

And all we'll ever have is each other
Let a chick try to come around
We both know she'll never be down
She'll never have your back, wouldn t know how to act
Can't say it no better than that

I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you 
I don't know what to do


If I had to, I would give up everything just to feel and be with you
If I had to, I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you
If I had to, I would give my very last breath just to help save you
And If I had to, I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth

Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you
And I'll do anything that pleases you
Only you


If I had to, I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you
If I had to, I would die all alone living there without you
If I had to, I would go through all the pain again just to find you
If I had to, I'd surrender all my love just because I love you


I don't understand why I'm crazy over you
I don't know what to do 
I don't understand why I'm crazy over you 
I don't know what to do 


Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth 
I'd die for you, ooh, 'cause I'm a fool in love with you 
And I'll do anything that pleases you 
Ooh, I'd ride for you 'cause you're the truth

And I'll do anything that pleases you 
Only you

My head's killing me, I'm losing sleep

Early in the morning and it's starting already
Why my name always involved 
I try to get rid of the baggage
Fake friends I call them "has-been"
Yeah, they lying on stuff
And it's okay if they don't show me love, no


They want me to lie down
They want me to crawl
They want me to cry now
But I'm never falling off


Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders 
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody 
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders  
Get off of me, , get off of me 
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody
Get off of me, yeah, get off of me, yeah 
'Cause in the end, I'm still the same girl 
Same girl

Que yo no puedo olvidarte
Eso lo sabe ella
Que s lo quiero amarte
Eso lo sabe' ya
Que somos dos parte', ah-ah
No vale la pena pedir otra oportunidad


A m  me parece que a ti tambi n se te olvida 
Cu ntas noches me dejaste sola y arrepentida 
Yo tambi n estoy sufriendo m s con tu partida 
Pero en este momento voy a empezar mi vida 


Se acab  el amor, uoh
Se acab  el amor entre t  y yo
Se acab  el amor, uoh
Aunque yo te ame
Por eso hoy te digo adi s



Ya esto se acab , wuh
De llorar por ti me duele la cabeza
Es hora de hacer borr n y cuenta nueva
Cu ntas noches agonizando por ti 
Me voy pa' la fiesta, fiesta 
A olvidarte mujer
Por muy dif cil que me parezca, lo intentar 

It's like I'm lost
I don't know
But this feeling that I have about you
Will you ever know 


Secretly 
I'm wanting you 
And I'm hoping you want me too 
I smell your scent  across the room 
And I can't wait to get next to you 

Whatever I see 
Whatever I hear 
Whatever I do 
Oh, baby, and it's got me thinking of you 


Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too 
I smell your scent across the room 
And I can't wait to get next to you 


Whenever you speak 
Whenever you move 
Whenever you breathe 
Baby, let me touch you  please


Secretly 
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too 
I smell your scent across the room 
And I can't wait to get next to you 
Secretly
I'm wanting you
And I'm hoping you want me too 
I smell your scent across the room
And I can't wait to get next to you

Mr. Worldwide!
Ha ha ha
With the mami, with the sexiest body
J.Lo, let's ride!


I would like, to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
I would like to get, to know you, baby
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
Like, to get, a piece of that sexy body
A piece of that sexy body


I got the flow that took over the globe, yeah
I got the cribs on the island for sure, yeah
I got the jet fueled up, ready to go
I put my money where my mouth is
I got the bread to blow
Baby believe me, baby you need me
Don't deceive me, then we'll be straight
And whenever you see me
Baby just tease me
I like a little foreplay, yeah that's great
Now you're thinking that you know me
But you don't 'cause I do things these men won't
These boys act like they're ballers
But they ain't
I definitely do the things that they can't
I'm in my own world, girl, no rules, no laws
No thongs, no bras
Now show me that sexy body, baby, I wanna see it all

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Ooh, ooh


I've been so
Caught up in the thought of me and you
Even though I love
Someone else I know my heart belongs to you
Tell me, how did we ever let the situation get this far 
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside
Things I know we can't deny


Should've never told you that I cared about you
Didn't think that it would be so bad
Should've never kissed you
Should've never held your hand
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go


What did I
Do the day I let you slip into my soul  
It was then, when I
Realized that I would always want you in my life 
No one else can know
Of the things that we've been saying on the telephone
It would be so bad
If they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each other



Dime que pas 
Se te olvid  mi nombre

Un sue o y un destino
La fe que me faltaba por vivir

The man on your own
Why don't you put some bass in your tone 
Can't you see that it is lonely
Taking care of, all day long 
You're making me leave
Shouldn't have gave me a reason to breathe
Definitely not, no, that's not what I mean


I'm so done with pleasing you, I'm so over needing you
All this space just gave me room so I could fly
What I thought would make me die makes me feel like I'm alive
Boy, you words don't carry weight to hold me down

I'm still so good over you
I'm still so good over you
Even if I didn't have a dollar in the bank
Even if you were my only way
I'm still so good over you
I'm still good

Dime por qu  te me vas y nada puedo hacer
 Qu  pecado cometi para marcharte as  de m  
S  que esta es la  ltima vez que me ver s y te ver 


Ya no es f cil olvidar, perd  la oportunidad
No me puedo perdonar, sigo mi camino
Y sigo sola, conmigo caminando a solas
Mi mundo se derrumba todo
Me queda seguir, esperar y cambiar y llorar y dejarlo todo
Quitarme el llanto de mis ojos
Alimentando esta ilusi n y soportando este dolor


Caminar por las calles y ver
Que las cosas no pueden volver
Ver la gente a mi lado pasar
Sin que puedan y quieran pensar
Y tal vez sea una nueva estaci n
Que me pone de nuevo en el rol
Protag nico fin de terror
Con el miedo de la involuntad
De mirarme y querer escapar
De creer y volver a caer
Del delirio de la decepci n
Y esta vez disparaste a matar

Yo, look clown, I come through, put it down
Keep thinkin' that you hard, take a look around
I got soldiers stationed up to bring pain
And when it go down, my hoes do the same thing
We all in the same gang, we all willin' to bang
Ain't nobody going against the grain
So take aim, B.R.'s evasive
Cut all the faces, catch all the cases, this real
You rather bet your life than face me
I mean, I got this rap game locked with more cake than Tastee
Black the fiendish, uh, the title I hold, I won't relinquish
And this type shit you should distinguish
And one phone call and I'll extinguish
I mean this, you seen this
Blue steel, four-four the caliber
Excalibur, I'ma destroy my next challenger
B. Rob, high post MC
Quick to spray Raid on a roach MC
So don't be approachin' me without the cross and rosary
Who this nigga 'posed to be  I'll blast him in the open beef
Damn Black, how you do that there 
'Cause we don't care, I'll take 'em there


Last night, I dreamed of some more dough
Some Cristal, six pistols and ten dimes of 'dro
That's when I realized I'm dreaming
Too late now, I guess I'll finish what I started, baby

Oh, oh
Oh, oh


He's all right, he's all wrong
He's a player, he's a dog
He's my friend, he's my foe
I just can't leave him, I can't go
I got my reasons, got my pride
I got these kids, we got these ties
We had this love, I had these dreams
I'm falling apart at the seams

He's my man when we're at home
And it can't hurt if I don't know
All his secrets, all his lies
I just keep pushing, out my mind
I wish that everybody would stop judging
Pointing fingers, it's cutting
My heart is broken up, I'm open, and feeling so bad
I've gotta make decisions
I'm strong, but who am I kidding 
I'll be okay, but this love is tearing me in half


Nobody wants to be the one breaking up
I'm down on my knees, I'm praying for this love
I'm in love , I'm still in love 
I just don't think , that it's enough 
I can feel, it getting colder
I'm afraid, of starting over


He makes me feel like a child
He makes me happy when he smiles
He makes me sad, he makes me mad
I wanna give him all I have
And I have tried to treat him good
Show support like I should
Did my part, he's my heart
And I've been faithful from the start

Say, ha
Yeah, woo! Woo!


Through the bumpy roads, the others bite the dust
'Cause they be thinking they're in love when their in lust
But clich  breaking up so easy
I'm about to throw a curve ball, honey
People let the stormy weather push them out
But back against the road it's easy to be over
Don't sweat the little things, wake up
Stay together, it's a new break up


Everyday, I think how we done it
Every way that we can keep loving
Toe-to-toe, we so strong
And on and on, we up and running
Not a day goes by without dreaming
Not a thing goes out, just keep reaching
Through the storm, we stay warm
And on and on, we keep on loving


The stars are in our favor 
This time comes second nature 
Heartbreaks are overrated
Stay together, that's the new trend
Boy, we done started something serious 
'Cause romance is underrated 
Stay together, that's the new trend

Step into my world
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh
Oh, oh, yeah, yeah
Woah-oh-oh


Like a moth to a flame, you know you're drawn to me
I know you better than you know yourself, baby
Why do you try to resist what you want, honey 
I want you to give me what I need, listen closely

I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just


Step into my world
Where there's countless things to see
Endless possibilities
Let me take you to a place where desires flow deep
See an odyssey of dreams and the best of fantasies
All this for your eyes only, ooh, step into my world


Close your eyes and let your feelings now take over
It's alright, I'm intoxicating you though you're sober
You inside, the thought alone is so overbearing
Boy, tonight you just follow my lead from here and


I need you to hold on me
I need you to kiss on me
Feel your body next to me
I want you to, I need you to
Want you to give into me
Want all of you, everything
Ecstasy is what I will bring you if you just

Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh


When I sleep  I have dreams about the way we used to kiss
'Bout the way you used to hold me
And say nothing would ever harm me
When we first met, oh, how you charmed me
Made me smile when I was down
Big pimping around the town, you and me
Whenever they'd see you, they'd see me
A lover and a friend to me you were, how did it end 
How it hurts to not have you in my life
When I wanted to be your wife

You never know what you have 'til it's gone
Treated you wrong for so long
Now you're gone away
But the love still lives here


Still, I still got love for you
Still, after all we've been through
Still, I gave my heart to you
And baby, you're the only one 
There's other men than you
Still, they can come close to you
Still, once I said, "I love you"
I knew you'd be the only one


A good man you were to me, always there to care
Would do anything in this world for me 
Didn't matter, what, when, or where, you were there
I never thought we'd part from the arguments we'd start
When I just wanted to get some attention 
And I'm sorry, baby for bitching
If I could take back the words
That I said to make you leave
I'd be down on bended knees
Asking you to please forgive me

Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you 
Like yesterday, I still can hear your voice, you promised to be
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there
Well, it's been a while and here we are looking back on times that we've shared


I still imagine us being young and so in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Feels like it's always just been us

I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around 


I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me


I still imagine us being young and still in love
Never apart, you were my heart
Makes me smile, we're still in love


I remember we were in the park
Holding hands and you said to me
I'm the only thing you need
And I would make your life complete
If I said I'd be your girl
You would stay with me forever
Boy, you never let me down
Through it all you're still around

Your relation to me
Feeds my empty existence
I guess I choose what to see
Because I m feeling resistance
So turn the lights on below
The time we have is too precious
You say that you ll never go
I know that lying is infectious now
So don t let me down


I m breaking my own rules today, ohh
I know that I should walk away, ohh
I m falling again for someone who doesn t feel alright
That s the story of my life


I thought you were ready to be
The start of my happy ending
Sometimes I choose what to see
Forget what I ve been defending

Before the day fades to day
There comes a break in the weather
I made you say goodbye
Because I can t say forever, now
So don t let me down, no

Black bottles, black models
Cuban cigars, Domincanos
Colombianos, it's 
100 dope boys on the sofa
I'm going fishin' with Versace on
Stars on the roof for the ambiance
Dug up some more hundreds, fought a few cases
Now we in the club throwing blue faces
Used to see Papi at the 
Now I'm crack sittin' on gold toilets
Pure heroine brings more spoils
Large, you people never be royal

You can buy me way more bottles then them other sections
Leave 1000 dollar tip, what blessin'
All eyes on us, ain't nobody in the club lookin' at your direction
So let me ask you one question
Do we look like we're stressin'  Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'  Cause we ain't
Do we look like we're stressin'  Cause we ain't


Coke  more opus
Break up the makeup, we got motives
I market America, that teamwork
Three keys in my sleep, now that's dream work
It's the Hublot show
Seven figures on the wrist like you don't know
The haters lookin' at me cause the mommies lookin' at me
Fed's lookin' at me, all the snitches lookin' happy
Fo' hunnid on the race, that's hella dough
Just to see the stars with no telescope
I got the pussy wetter than that yayo
Get it off of the block, that J. Lo




Alexander McQueen, Balmain Jeans
Everything all black like the Beijing
Cop the Red Octobers since the Valentine
Have Cupid shoot that ass like 1000 times
In the cell got the wrong number
But she gone be in La Marina all summer
And she gone be up in my tub half naked
And I just sold the plug 

Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh
Oh oh oh


He could be the hottest man alive
But he can't hold a flame up to you and I
'Cause I'm so much better when I'm standing by your side
And I can do anything
As long as you're in my life
Since you've been around
All I ever wanna do is try to hold you down
And there's nothing, nothing that I can do
'Cause you make me feel like...


I can stop a train if I want to
Can't nothing get in my way
'Cause I got you
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you, I'm stronger, stronger
I can tell the sun when to shine
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life
And baby, we can rule the world
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger
You got me singing yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm stronger, I'm stronger
Yeah, yeah, yeah
'Cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger

Make tonight first class with no stops
Girl, you know I run a love game, never play Uno
You wanna leave, follow me to the two-door
Rock your culo, love it when you call me your papi chulo
I got a thing for you, you got a thing for me
Heard she kiss the Milky Way and bring to life your fantasies
You're sweeter than Mama's homemade Kool-Aid
Touch it, then make the seas split two ways
You love it, I do too, girl, don't play
I'm just waitin' to hear you say


Let's hit the sweet spot, oh, I, I, I, I

You know, you know, you know that I love ya

You know, you know, you know that I need ya
I need ya


I need my baby like I need air, I need air, I need air
I need my baby 'cause he take me there, take me there, take me there
The only thing my baby said, "Baby, what you want "
What you, want, want, want  Yeah, gimme what I want


Yeah, yeah. yeah
My baby take care, care, yeah


You know, you know, you know that I love ya
I love ya
You know, you know, you know that I need ya
I need ya
'Cause you're my man, you're my friend
You're my everything I need
Everything I need, everything I need
And I love you, I love you, I really, really love you

I saw you and fell in love
You saw me and fell in love too
You and me, we fell in love with each other last night
I told you I was concerned
You told me of your concerns too
Yet and still we both decided to make love last night
Baby, please tell me


Where do we go from here, my love 
What are we doing, baby 
Boy, you gotta let me know
Why can't we live the way we want 
I want the world to know
I just gotta let it show
What do we stand to lose
If being together is what we choose 
Oh, my love
I think that we should talk about us


Could this be a crazy dream 
And if so, then you're dreaming too 
'Cause I know for sure that you feel the same as I do

You feel the same
Could it be that we could be wrong 
Even though we're feeling so right  
I don't care because I know that I want you tonight
And I know you want me too




Fifty hundred threads in my linen sheets
Look like you missing waking up next to me
Staying relevant, stay on this shit you focused on
Like it's the day you forever, ain't the past to me
Te bot , eh, eh


You got it all twisted
I checked out a long time ago
Texting, you missed it
Touch it, had enough that
She got you sprung
So I pulled up, they start a case of charity
After you begging me, begging for company
Never needed you, you only needed me
All that talk just to settle being weak
Had too much tequila, so save that shit for the next one
It goes in one ear, and out the next one
Said you put me out, why you lying 
I left on my own, had you crying
I was tryna keep your bidness silent
Tried to keep the peace instead of being violent
Thought we squashed the bygones and remained friends 
Truth be told, you're the one that's high maintenance
Let's be real, I threw you out
 El a-El anillo pa' cu ndo 
But your time ran out
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh

Your heart is hard to carry after dark
You're to blame for what we could have been
'Cause look at what we are
Your friends are scared to tell you, you went too far
Funny that it's always been all about you from the start
I met someone new last night and we kicked it
And I'm going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind, this time
Going back there tonight
And you know what's on my mind so

If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me 
If you had my love
And I gave you all my trust
Would you comfort me 
And if somehow you knew
That your love would be untrue
Would you lie to me 
Out of body
That's just how I feel when I'm around you, shawty
Last night we didn't say it
But girl, we both thought it
Why second guess  I should have stayed
You say the word, I'm on the way
This shit feels like teenage fever
I'm not scared of it, she ain't either
Why second guess  I should have stayed
'Cause you know what's on my mind so

I wanna see legends, legends, legends, statements and stars, stars
Hit the floor, girls


Stars and the statements and the legends called
Jack's turning this to all-out war
'Cause here I come
Everybody wanna be a superstar, riding around in a rental car


I wanna see runway
I wanna see old way
I wanna see new way
I wanna see you slay
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway
Eating the runway, serving the runway, marching the runway
Eat that runway, walk



Aunque todo lo que ves se terminara
Aunque ya nunca volviera a amanecer
Si de pronto en el silencio me encontrara
Yo me ir a tras de ti, lo sabes bien
Y si fueras t  mi  ltima esperanza
Tras tu huella mi camino buscar 
Creo en eso que el amor te lleva al cielo
De pedirme en el naufragio, s lvame
Creo en eso de esperar el d a nuevo
Que lo nuestro es para siempre, ya lo s 
Y  qu  importa si el destino se indignara 
O si alguien dijera que este amor no puede ser, ay, yo

Si tu voz no la escuchara entre mis sue os
Y tus ojos no me guiaran para ver
Volver a de otra vida por tu encuentro
Volver a para verte, cr eme
Si tu voz no la escuchara entre mis sue os
Y tus ojos no me guiaran para ver
Volver a de otra vida por tu encuentro
Volver a para verte, cr eme


Ya las dudas y los miedos se me fueron
Ya no tengo m s secretos que esconder
Y a partir de este momento yo decreto
Que no hay nadie que me pueda detener
No voy a pensar en que vendr  manana
Quiero despertar contigo cada amanecer, ay, yo


Si tu voz no la escuchara entre mis sue os
Y tus ojos no me guiaran para ver
Volver a de otra vida por tu encuentro
Volver a para verte, cr eme
Si tu voz no la escuchara entre mis sue os
Y tus ojos no me guiaran para ver
Volver a de otra vida por tu encuentro
Volver a para verte, cr eme

They said we couldn't make it
They said it wouldn't last
But look who's talkin' now
We had the last laugh
Yeah, we seen some fire
And we felt some pain
We been through the toughest times
And we'd do it all again


It's you and me against the world
Yeah!


That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody it's true
Yes, I do
That's how strong our love is
That's how strong our love is
Gonna tell everybody 'bout you
Yes, I do


Nobody believed
That we'd last this long
Nobody believed it
But we proved them wrong
And all the trouble and strife
That life sometimes brings
If we can get through this
We can get through anything

Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh


Said she gave you everything
She broke her back to be what you need
I tried so long to just compete
Can't take no more, losing sight of me
I'm letting you know this can't go on
This one-way street, I'm walking alone
This time I'm breaking free
I'm gonna find me


I can't sit and be passive
Won't tolerate no more, that's it
I tried so hard to be 
What you wanted me to be 
If it can't be 50/50
Then know that it don't fit me
I can't give you all that's in me
'Cause, baby, that's not me

Uh-huh, yeah
Darkchild, Jennifer Lopez
Let's dance


I know you see me watching
Although you're tryna play it
Like you don't 
When I know you do 
You've got the every want thing
That kind of every need thing
You're what I want 
So come give it up, yeah

I won't stop until I get what I want 
So what am I to do 
'Cause what I want is you 
Baby, stop and think 
What you and I could be 
Together, I know we  can be perfectly complete 


Baby, I can give you anything 
If you promise to be with me 
I promise I can make you happy
'Cause that's the way our love should be 
No one could love you better anyway 
You'll never find another close to me 
I promise I can make you happy
And that's the way our love should be


Why are you tryna deny
Me of the loving that's mine 
Just let it go 
Let me take control 
Boy, I got just what you want
And all the love you need
Once you grab a hold 
You won't let me go , no

Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got
I'm still, I'm still Jenny from the block
Used to have a little, now I have a lot
No matter where I go I know where I came from
Do you know where you're going to 
Do you like the things that life's been showing you 
Where are you going to 
Do you know 
Do you gain what you're hoping for 
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for 
Do you know 


Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our mind
You knew how I loved you, but my spirit was free
Laughing at the questions that you once asked of me

Do you know where you're going to 
Do you like the things that life's been showing you 
Where are you going to 
Do you know 


Now looking back on all we planned
We let so many dreams just slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answers to our those questions can be 


Do you know where you're going to 
Do you like the things that life's been showing you 
Where are you going to 
Do you know 
Do you gain what you're hoping for 
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for 
Do you know 


Do you know 
Taking away the fact that I care about you, it's just your way
So sweet, everything seems right around you
Did you know that you had this calming way about you when you touch 
And I wanna know if I could be your girl


The one put her arms around you
The one who lays her head beside you 
The one who listens when you need it
When no one else is, I could see it 
The one who knows when it's under control
The one who knows your favorite song 
The one you want when you're feeling lost
The one you place no one above


I'm happy to say in a lot of ways you've changed me
Makes me smile when you said you were glad the day you found me
I'm wishing away any harm that might ever find you
Heaven knows, I really feel I'll always be your girl

You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home


Yeah, hey
Oh, oh my goodness, this beat is so hard...

Oh, oh my goodness, this beat is so hard

I'ma go hard, hard to the core
Hard like motherfucking liquid swords
Harder than worldwide stadium tours
I am the future, DeLorean doors
Willy survive, never deceased
I don't think I'ma ever gon' rest in peace
I'ma kill the game, leave the rest in pieces
Now everybody want my recipes
Tell a jealous chicken
I don't know what the beef is
I'm just making money for my grankids' nieces
I'ma work hard, that's my thesis
This beat is the shit, feces 
Pardon me, ma'am
I'ma go dumb, smart.i.am
I'm complicated, Hard.i.am
I end the beginning, then start it again


You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home
You can go hard or you can go home

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah, ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah


It always feels like a love to me in the beginning
My mind is just a mirror of the way my heart wants it to be
I hope to see everything in his eyes
'Cause that's where it starts with the truth and the lies
And I cannot hide my emotions
You cannot hide your intentions from me


Don't you think, what I'm saying is
It's just the way it is, it's just the way it is 
Not everything is what you say it is
That's just the way it is, the way it is, the way it is


And everything you do to me, it'll be done to you
And everything I put you through, well then, I'll go through
But I'm willing to take that chance 
For this type of romance
Its special, baby 
I always look for love to be, so exciting
But you can't force it, I'm finding
In reality, chemistry is everything

I believe in never let my strip get hotter
Than something I can get out of, one that heats up on me
I told 'em this would be a one time dance
Meaning one time chance after I said that, oh
That's when he got close to me
All the other music stopped but the violin
Conversation, one dance, sip a bottle of the best
Now I'm asking myself, "What has he done to me "


This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me

Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me


Gotta call a cab if I don't need gonna have me
With every young stunna in the hood wanna have me
Uh, so much of him I couldn't surrender
'Cause I know where this could end up
And with that right now I can't play
I know I drive him loco but that's just the way
You make a mama's hips go


This can't turn into love, no
The rose petals were all in the air
Just might need that firetruck to come and get me


Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Can't say I don't want it 'cause he really put it on me
In a way that I don't know if I'm going or coming
Dip me in water 'cause this boy's fire
Has got a hold of me
Didn't have to know from your body put it on me
Not just physically but mentally, andale on me

This is me now
This is me now
This land is your land, this land is my land
From the California to the New York island
From the redwood forest to the Gulf Stream waters
This land was made for you and me


As I went walking down that ribbon of highway
I saw above me that endless skyway
I saw below me that golden valley
This land was made for you and me, oh
This land
This land
This land was made for you and me, oh
This land
Oh, this land
This land was made for you and me
You and me, oh

America America god shed his grace on thee
And crown thy good with brotherhood
From sea to shining sea





Let's get loud
This land was made for you and me
There some freaks in the living room getting it on
And they ain't leaving til 6 in the mornin' 


If you don't know were you're from
Then you don't know were your going
But I'm so lit, I don't know where I'm at or where i'm going
She take a couple shots of the patrone
She wanna get my name tatted on
I took her to the tattoo shop
So she could get a tattoo with my name on
Time is money, I got money on my mind
Life is short, I'm just tryin' buy time
Tik tok, baby life is a race
Just make sure you mak  a pit stop
Woo!


Don't stop, make it pop
DJ, blow my speakers up
Tonight, Imma fight
Til w  see the sunlight
Tik Tok on the clock
But the party don't stop, no
Woah-oh oh oh
Woah-oh oh oh 


En medio del mar
Buscando un puerto
Y anclar
T  vienes y vas
As  como las olas
So ando solo en tu libertad
Sin admitir que la verdad te da miedo
Volver a amar
Y yo te quiero liberar
Y t  no ves lo que te puedo dar


Toma de m 
Toma mi alma y te dar  mi alegr a
Toma mi cuerpo y sana de tus heridas
Totalmente
Toma de m 
Toma mi fe y ser  yo el mar de t  isla
Toma mi amor y volver s a la vida misma
Lentamente
No te arrepentir s no
Ya no des marcha atr s
Ya no des marcha atr s

First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way
You say that you had to go away
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late


Like a puppet on a string
You came and took control of me
Would've given anything
To be your one and only
Filled my head with fantasies
Of what one day you would give to me
Full of hope for what could be
I sat and waited patiently

First you say that you have to go away 
I never should've been with you anyway 
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way 
You say that you had to go away 
I never really loved you anyway
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late


For a time you were for me
Everything that I could need
Gave me time and diamond rings
But something else was missing
You never stayed the whole night through
I suffered, prayed, and cried for you
After all that we've been through
I feel I never even knew you


First you say that you have to go away
I never should've been with you anyway 
And now you say you wanna stay 
It's too late 'cause I'm sending you on your way 
You say that you had to go away 
I never really loved you anyway 
And now you say you wanna stay
It's too late, it's too late

Go!


This love is so dangerous
But I kind of like the thrill
It's like a sugar rush
It's all in the way you make me feel
I didn't see you coming, but you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh

I gotta admit you're fly
And I love it how you talk, babe
Getting all in my mind
Running it like a field play
I didn't see you coming
But you broke me down
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Don't you walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, and


This ain't no ordinary boy
This ain't no ordinary boy
See the funny thing about you
You got me doing things I wouldn't do
You ain't no ordinary boy
You gon' be troubeaux

You gon' be troubeaux

You gon' be troubeaux


I, deep down know I should be good
I ain't blind, you're the kind of guy
That always got all these girls running after you
Do I entertain or play with you  Or just be cool 
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos
One smile, and oh
Don't sleep, I think I'ma burn too fast
So close, wrapped up in the heat of love
I'm having fantasies of how it's gonna be
'Cause you got some nerve about you
Walk up like I know you
Both hands and your tattoos, still

Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh


I like the way that your body move all over the floor 
I'd like to find a way to get lost in you 
I wanna talk to ya, baby, say what's on your mind, uh
Girl, tell me anything that you wanna do 

Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight 
Got a crazy feeling that I fit you just right


So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby, I got what you need, you gotta try me
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Woo, ooh, ooh, ooh 


Let's go and find a place and get to know each other more 
It's all on your face, I know you like what you see  
I'm the one for you, baby, but you can take your time 
Let the music bring your body to me  


Ain't we all just looking for some loving tonight  
Got a crazy feeling that I fit you just right


So try me in the morning when the sun comes rising up
Try me in the afternoon, bet you just can't get enough
Try me in the evening, satisfaction guaranteed
Baby, I got what you need, you gotta try me
I know
I got what you need, you gotta try me



Me gustan esas peque as cosas
Cuando te encuentras conmigo a solas
Y tengo tanto para decirte
En lo que quieras yo voy a seguirte
No hablemos nada, oye el silencio
Es el lenguaje de nuestros cuerpos
Y a veces pienso que apareciste
Para mostrarme que el amor existe

T , todo t 
Siempre t 
Todo t 


Parar el tiempo me gustar a
Para fumarme a tu dulce filosof a
Sentirme amiga del universo
Y en tu mirada ver el mismo cielo
Por cada estrella, por cada noche
Se encuentran nuestras almas y se reconocen
Porque lo quieres, porque lo pides
Voy a mostrarte que el amor existe


T , todo t 
Siempre t 
Todo t

I was down for the count
Feeling like I've come to the end
Nothing really mattered
Nothing left for me to mend
Ooh, but then you came, and I still couldn't see
'Til you tore down every wall in me
How you healed me with your patience
If it's all I ever do, I'll never stop loving you


'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you
I was fading, but you pulled m  through

But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more

Was in place full of pain
With a broken down heart in despair
He took away my feelings
And made it hard for me to care
Ooh, but then you crashed through the door, to my soul
Put back all the pieces and made me whole
I was living in the past, oh no
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back


'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe
And there ain't doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it
I'm in love, and it's all because of you

But there ain't no doubt about it, it's love, and I have found it
Feel the beat again, stronger than before
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more


Whatever you want me to
I'm gonna see you through
All I ever do
Never stop loving you

JLo


Now somehow you feel left out
Somehow you're feeling doubt
Got an inch but took a mile, oh no
Right now your body's in need
Can't replace what you had in me
My words are cutting deep, oh no

You've watched me fall, now I'm colder than winter
My love you forgot, let me help you remember
I loved you like you never been
So overdosed on your own medicine


There's no need to call me on the phone
Telling me how much you're alone
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, I'm the villain
I told you that you would need my love
I gave you my all, but that wasn't enough
Enemy of my state of mind
Now I'm a villain, baby, I'm the villain of your love


Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love, love
Baby, I'm the villain, baby, I'm the villain


Oh, now you get the picture
Oh oh, now you wanna fix her
Oh oh, now you're screaming, "Let's go back"
I ain't having that
But now my love ain't around
It's behind walls that won't come down
But now you wanna show up and turn my sour sweet
You gon' miss me
Caught in me, lost in you
Head spinnin'

I'm helpless 

Play your heart like a violin
You pull the strings and you pull me in


A veces llega la lluvia
Para limpiar las heridas
A veces s lo una gota
Puede vencer la sequ a


Y para qu  llorar,  pa' qu  
Si duele una pena, se olvida
Y para qu  sufrir,  pa' qu  
Si as  es la vida, hay que vivirla


Voy a re r, voy a bailar
Vivir mi vida, la, la, la, la
Voy a re r, voy a gozar
Vivir mi vida, la, la, la, la


Voy a vivir el momento
Para entender el destino
Voy a escuchar en silencio
Para encontrar el camino
None
Oh, yeah


Like a movie scene
In the sweetest dreams
I have pictured us together
Now to feel your lips
On my fingertips
I have to say is even better
Than I ever thought it could possibly be
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free
From all of my sadness, the tears that I've cried
I have spent all of my life

Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh


Tender words you say
Take my breath away
Love me now and leave me never
Found a sacred place
Lost in your embrace
I want to stay in this forever
I think of the days when the sun used to set
On my empty heart, all alone in my bed
Tossing and turning, emotions were strong
I knew I had to hold on


Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight, oh
When you would be here in my arms
Waiting for tonight, oh-oh
I've dreamed of this love for so long
Waiting for tonight
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

I can't wait, wanna see how this night is gonna be
Just a touch away from the feeling that is here to stay


We can make it last forever, baby
Our love will stand the test of time 
In the middle of the world
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine 


We're walking on sunshine in the middle of the night
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky-y-y-y

Take my hand, close your eyes
Say the sweet little things that make me cry
Catch my tears with a kiss
These special moments do exist

Until the end of time

We are, we are
Not your ordinary fami-mily
But we can all agree that
We are, we are
Close as close can be


We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are are are are 
We are, Family

So it don't matter what it looks like
We look perfect to me
We got every kind of love
I feel so lucky indeed
They can keep on talking
It don't matter to me cause
We are, we are family
Family, we are, we are


Ham and Cheese
No! It's we are family
Nah


Ok, so the links in our chain makes us strange
But really they make us stronger
And I wouldn't replace not a thing
Mother or father 
Cause we


Cause we come from everywhere 
Searching for ones to care
Somehow we found it here
We found us a home

Ooh baby, come and talk to me
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about


The way you looked at me tells me you're sorry
You walked by me whispering you love me
When I tried to hold you tight you pulled away
But you wanted me to stay, instead you ran away
Baby, talk to me, let's stop playing games
Don't turn away from me, just look me straight in the eyes
Don't try to sweet talk me with those nasty words you say
Baby, just be real and tell me how you feel


Ooh baby, come and talk to me 
Together we can work this out
We got a love thing
We're talking about


The way you tricked me you know that wasn't right, ooh
You tried to fix it but all we did was fight
Because I gave you everything I had to give
If you know it's worth the fight, we got to compromise
Baby, talk to me and tell me what's wrong
Come sit down next to me and let me feel the vibe you're on
Come lay your head on me and everything will be alright
But we must communicate, tomorrow it could be too late

C'mon man, I need something that I can move to
You needa give me some of that funk
Yeah, uh, yeah, woo
Yeah, uh, woah, uh
Uh, uh, woah, uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 


Pulled up at the red light
Cutie popped up on my left side
Window down, waiting for my reply
Not a word, I saw it in his eyes
Tell me something good, baby
He said, "Whatever you want to do" 
He pulled to the curb, houses flash by 
I got out with the catwalk shy 
Short skirt, golden brown thighs
Gucci heels, four inch high
He touched my face
Smiled and said, "Whatever you want to do" 

Now I, said I usually need some time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
Maybe we need tonight
Whatever you want


We sipping, music all loud
Conversation, your lollypop mouth
You open up, sweet things come out
Whisper to me, what you talking about 
I said, "I think you know"
He said, "Whatever you want to do" 
You stand up, taking my breath 
It's your song so you do it two steps 
I turned away, moved my hips slow 
Your thoughts, fully exposed
Now we better stop playing
I said, "Boy, whatcha gonna do " 


Now I, oh I, usually take my time to get inside
So I don't know why you and me feel so right
You and I need tonight


Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 
Whatever you want 

Whatever you don't know
Baby, I will teach you
Anywhere you go
Know my love can reach you
Not a wall too high
Or a mountainside
Could keep me from seeing you


Whenever you're too tired
I could give you power
Go the extra mile
In your darkest hour
Any day or night
Call my name and I
I'll come running to be with you


And I'll be fierce as a tiger
If anyone tries to fight ya
But I'll be soft as a lamb
When you're in my hands
I can bend
However I need to

Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na, na na na na na na
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na


People told me I should write a love song
"Girl, you sound so angry, you could use some variation"
But I'm lonely, negative relations
I've been hurt so many times, I don't have the patience


But I've wished for so long
For someone to come and show me, lead by example
'Cause I've been waiting
I've tried every age, I'm so tired of the game
 I wanna be somebody's girl
Would you show me the way 


What if I never find, and I'm left behind 
Should I keep hoping for love 
What if I'm still the same, status doesn't change 
Gotta keep hoping for love
What is love  What is love  What is love 
Somebody show me
What is love  What is love  What is love 
'Cause if you told me
What is love  What is love  What is love 
I wouldn't be lonely 
Please, show me

I've had blind dates, hooked up with some real flakes
I gone out with church boys, musicians are thee worst
I've tries so hard cause I'm just so die hard
Tried my best to play the part, wish you could see inside
But I wished for so long for some one to come and show me

People Dying 
People Crying

To bring some lovin' here today

For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way

Picket lines  and picket signs 
Don't punish me  with brutality 
Talk to me , so you can see

Mother, moth r
Everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply 'cause our hair is long 
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh-oh

Standing here, all at once
All the words run dry
Something's changed, can't explain
And I can't deny


Turning in circles and blurring the lines of the unspoken
It's calling us tonight


I won't lie
I'm a little bit frightened by my imagination
I swear I'll try
Cause I'm feeling enlightened, my inspiration
We can fly if we want to
I promise you, faith will give you wings
Just take the second star on the right
Straight ahead 'til the morning light


Close your eyes, when you dream
That's where I will be
Say it's true
Say you do 
Say you do believe

I just met infatuation
It's something in his smile
Now my obsession can t stand the thoughts of you and I
Something takes over, pulls me up onto my feet
Before I know it, I got you pushing up on me


On the floor
Under the burning lights
Stranger lurking behind
Hands on this waist of mine
And I don't know where this will lead
But I'm hoping you tell me


Out here whipping my hair all crazy, baby
Doin  it like I'm at work
I'm making that thang jerk
I'm making that thang twerk 
I'm doin' what I do
I make it move
Got me out here whipping my hair, ahh


Baby, I just might have what you need
Sprinkling you with pieces of me
Now let's make it a sight to see, baby

Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more
I'd give anything for you to come and help me perfect it
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry no more
I don't wanna worry
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you
Ain't no other way, they had to
I'ma always hold it down for ya
Look at how I move around for ya

Do anything that you can to make me feel so protected
I don't wanna worry no more 
Just want you to know my name by the time we exit
Wanna feel like I'm brand new
Even though I gotta have you
All them other bitches stab you
They was close enough to grab you 
I don't wanna worry no more


The feeling that you give me is a coke rush 
Addicted to fast money, white Lamborghini 
My name ring bells, authorities wanna see me 
Born king, I swore she was Nefertiti
Never been to Egypt, try to stay up out of debt 
IRS is watching, they follow us on my neck 
Still onto me but I'm only coming correct
This audio is gems, my niggas wanna collect
We the biggest in the game so let's just give us respect
Dance like a star, ass shake like a car
She really something special, I can tell from afar
Eyes on the check, 8-figures, feelin' best 
Hustle on the corner, Givenchy be the finesse 
Ex-drug dealer but still got his connects , yes 

Woah, oh, oh


Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for being headstrong
Now I'm going halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No scratch that, I was dead wrong


Know I shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, wouldas 'Cause you're gone


Now I'm out here tripping
'Cause you came up missing
And my head keeps spinning
It's getting out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone 
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone 
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone

Woah, oh, oh, uh


Guess I should've shut my mouth
But I had to get it out
So much for bein' headstrong
Now I'm goin' halfway out my mind
I know I was out of line
No, scratch that, I was dead wrong

And know I shoulda let it go
But I just had to be right
Ooh, coulda left it alone
But, no, I had to be right
Swear I woulda just fell back
If I knew all I'd be left with is these shoulda, coulda, woulda's 'Cause you're gone


Now I'm out here trippin'
'Cause you came up missin'
And my head keeps spinnin'
It's gettin' out of control
I'm backing down this time, I don't wanna fight
I don't care who's right
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone 
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone 
'Cause I'm wrong when you're gone, when you're gone


Heaven knows if you were here
I'd be all up in your ear
Least you could do is answer your phone
'Cause I realized my mistake
And baby, I'll do what it takes
If I could just get you one and one

One two three, in the place to be
As it is plain to see
