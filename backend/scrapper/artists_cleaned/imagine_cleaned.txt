
Could someone take me home where I'm supposed to be 
I'm on my back again, caught up in something
Could someone take me home  I could use a friendly face
Yeah, these leeches got to go
Yeah, I need a safe space


When am I gonna learn I've got to let things go 
Watching my candle burn, burn


'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
I don't need no one to believe
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one
'Cause I know what I'm meant to be
These people might not see
When it's all been said and done
I'm still my number one


Yeah, number one, two, three
You've let me down again, why am I surprised 
I'm on my back again, walking in the wind
I know how these things go 

Good morning my love
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have grown
Your eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Because thirty lives can be extraordinarily long


Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning myself
It's been a while since we have talked
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
But I am sure
That you'll keep living and breathing until this world turns over


Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Lay me down, lay me down
Again my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eyes
Because I am foolish and I am sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Good morning, my love
It's been a while since we first talked
And I have grown
My eyes are older than the tallest tree you see
Thirty lives can be extraordinarily long


Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
But I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright

Good morning, myself
It's been a while since we have spoken
And you have changed
For better or worse is yet to determine
I am sure
You'll keep living and breathing until this world rolls over


Lay me down, lay me down
Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
And I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright


Stay with me, stay with me
Forever


Again, my friend
I know it's been a while since I could look you in the eye
And I am foolish, and I'm sorry
But sorry never made it feel alright, alright
Take my Number..
Call me a 42
Now, hello my 42

42, number. 42, numberNone
Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change a lot and sign our name after the dot
Everything you see is just a century of anarchy
All my corresponding colors that symbolize the things we can attest
Arrange, we can assess, we can attain
We are the entry for entities to entice and entertain


All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me

Take my side
Take my side, don't look back
Now I'm easy and that's a fact
And you're on my mind, oh


Everything you say is just a lie and now I'm leaving
To the city where the people are awake to chase a dream that isn't real
And we're 'posed to be something that we're not
Just wanna change and sign our name after the dot


All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me


Now will the sun come up tonight 
Because your eyes they burn so bright
I'm all you've got, when you say that you want it all
You want it all


All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
All eyes, they're on you
Don't deny, you've got to
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
This is a call, that's all you'll ever get from me
I get caught in the water, get torn in the wind
I could drown in the river, while the sun burns dim
I get tossed by the ocean, fall deep in the sand
I m drowned out by the thunder, lost in the land


Is anyone listening 
Is anyone around to see 


That I m doing it all for you
I m doing it all for you
I m ready to go
I m ready to go
I m doing it all for you
I m doing it all for you
I m ready to go
I m ready to go




Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go
Twenty five seconds
Your heart will stop resting
Your body, start shaking
Your mind is now ready to go
Ready to go

If you can hold on
If you can hold on, hold on


I wanna stand up, I wanna let go
You know, you know; no, you don't, you don't
I wanna shine on in the hearts of man
I want a meaning from the back of my broken hand
Another head aches, another heart breaks
I'm so much older than I can take
And my affection, well, it comes and goes
I need direction to perfection, no, no, no, no


Help me out
Yeah, you know you got to help me out
Yeah, oh, don't you put me on the back burn, oh-whoa
You know you got to help me out, yeah
Is this just an illusion
That I made inside my head to get me by 
Twenty years in debt
Twenty years in the government
Twenty years can never get me by
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you

Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on
From farmers in the fields
To the tallest of the towers that fall and rise
1-7-7-6, the names upon the list
Of all the ones who gave until they died
Don't you hold back
I can see in your mind, and your mind will set you free
And I feel you close
Feel you close like you wanted me to
Feel you close
Like you wanted me to
Believe in you
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up 
Give me strength to press on
Rise to the top of the world
America, America, don't you cry
Lift me up
Give me strength to press on

Oh, hush, my dear, it's been a difficult year
And terrors don t prey on innocent victims
Trust me, darlin', trust me darlin'

Integrity, faith, and crocodile tears

Perfect paradise , tearin' at the seams 
I wish I could escape it , I don't wanna fake it

Now you know, now you know

Did all my dreams never mean one thing 
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring 
Oh, I ve been askin' for 
Oh, I ve been askin' for problems, problems, problems
I wage my war, on the world inside
I take my gun to the enemy's side
Oh, I've been askin  for

Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Stars are only visible in darkness
Fear is ever-changing and evolving
And I, I feel poisoned inside
But I, I feel so alive
Nobody can save me now
King is crowned
It's do or die
Nobody can save me now
The only sound
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Is the battle cry
Nobody can save me now
It's do or die


Alright so I guess we should get to work on building a farm


Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit  your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it


Thousand dollar sheets
Waitin  for you on some thousand dollar sheets
I got Carter III on repeat
Back shots to the beat of "A Milli" on you
Got me acting like you got a milli on you
He say I'm the GOAT, yeah, the billy on you
I could make all your dreams come true
Wanna fall through, then you better come through


But don't make me wait until the morning


Got a bed wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Got a kiss wit' your name on it
Wit' your name on it
Love me good, love me down
Don't turn me down
Got a bed wit  your nam  on it
Wit  your name on it
Out where the river broke
The bloodwood and the desert oak
Holden wrecks and boiling diesels
Steam in forty five degrees


The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact
It belongs to them
Let's give it back

How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning
How can we dance when our earth is turning
How do we sleep while our beds are burning


The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent, now
To pay our share


Four wheels scare the cockatoos
From Kintore East to Yuendemu
The western desert lives and breathes
In forty five degrees


The time has come
To say fair's fair
To pay the rent
To pay our share
The time has come
A fact's a fact

I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
The master of my sea, oh-ooh 
I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
That look at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the-

Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited, 'til it broke open and it rained down
It rained down like-

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses
Writing my poems for the few
Who look at me, took on me, shook on me, feeling me
Singing from heartache from the pain
Taking my message from the veins
Speaking my lesson from the brain
Seeing the beauty through the...


Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down you build me up, believer, believer
Pain!
Let the bullets fly, oh let them rain
My life, my love, my drive, it came from...

I was broken from a young age
Taking my sulking to the masses

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up above
All the hate that you've heard
Has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was chokin' in the crowd
Building my rain up in the cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they would drown
But they never did, ever lived, ebbin' and flowin'
Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down
It rained down, like 

Pain!
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain!
You break me down and build me up, believer, believer
Pain
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain

Last things last
By the grace of fire and flames
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh

Inhibited, limited 'til it broke open and rained down

First things first, can you imagine what's about to happen 
It's Weezy the dragon, I link with the Dragons
And we gon' get ratchet, no need for imaginin'
This is what's happenin'
Second thing second, I reckon immaculate
Sound about accurate
I know that strength, it don't come without strategy
I know that sweet, it don't come without cavities
I know the passages come with some traffic
I start from the basement, end up in the attic
And third thing third
Whoever count me out, they simply can't count
Let's get mathematic, I'm up in this, huh
Is you a believer 
I get a unicorn out of a zebra
I wear my uniform like a tuxedo
This dragon don't hold his breath, don't need a breather
Love you, Miss Cita, the son of a leader
I know the bloomin' don't come without rain
I know the losin' don't come without shame
I know the beauty don't come without 
Hold up, hold up, hold up
Last thing last
I know that Tunechi don't come without Wayne
I know that losin' don't come without game
I know that beauty don't come without
Don't come without 

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose


I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky


I'm bad at love
Pain
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Pain
You break me down, you build me up, beli ver, believ r
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you


Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
None
In the night so still
Oh, I'll build you a kingdom
In that house on the hill


Lookin' out for love
Big, big love


You said that you love me
And that you always will
Oh, you begged me to keep you
In that house 
Two hearts, one valve
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
We were the body and
Two lives, one life
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
Makin' it right


Seasons, they will change
Life will make you grow
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
Everything is temporary
Everything will slide
Love will never die, die, die


I know that
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I hope to see you again


Sunsets, sunrises
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves
Changin' the seasons
Some nights I think of you
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
Wishin' and dreamin'

Two hearts, one valve

Death can make you hard, hard, hard
Everything is temporary

Birds fly in different directions
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

So fly high, so fly high
None]
Nice to meet you, where you been 
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there, and I thought
"Oh my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play "
Eh, eh

]
New money, suit and tie
I could read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny, rumours fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
Dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I could make a bad guy good for a weekend
]
So, it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames
You can tell me when it's over
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause, you know, I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
And we'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name

]
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come
Oh, no

I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
I m bleeding out
I m bleeding out for you, for you


When the day has come
That I ve lost my way around
And the seasons stop
And hide beneath the ground
When the sky turns grey
And everything is screaming
I will reach inside
Just to find my heart is beating

Oh, you tell me to hold on
Oh, you tell me to hold on
But innocence is gone
And what was right is wrong
'Cause I'm bleeding out
So if the last thing that I do
Is bring you down
I'll bleed out for you
So I bare my skin and I count my sins
And I close my eyes and I take it in
And I m bleeding out
I m bleeding out for you, for you


When the hour is nigh
And hopelessness is sinking in
And the wolves all cry
To fill the night with hollering
When your eyes are red
And emptiness is all you know
With the darkness fed
I will be your scarecrow
Oh!
Oh!


Here I stand, all alone
Blood is on my hands
Blood is on my face
Here you stand, all alone
Blood is on your hands
Blood is on your face
Oh!

Oh, no!!
Oh, no!!
Woah, oh-oh
Woah, oh-oh

Woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah-woah
I'm always looking for
Something I can't afford
Something to work for
I don't know if it's healthy
Oh God, help me
I wanna be satisfied with what I have
I'm always chasing higher placement
This bump is not enough
And when I  hit the pavement
Don't save me
I'm such a waste of space


I'm always waiting for the weekend
I'm always hoping for a reset, yeah
I will be happy when I'm older
Why is everything never good enough for me 
Why is everything never


I'm never satisfied, I'm
Starting to blur
Waiting for the tid  to wash me out
Clean me up
'Caus  I am starting to blur
Yeah, I'm starting to blur

Gimme, gimme, gimme some time to think

How many lies do we have to tell 
To keep from saying, that I wish you well 
How many times I said I'm movin  on 
How many times that false alarm goes off  
Goes off  
I know I'll see you tomorrow


'Cause I m bad at lettin' you go, lettin' you go

How many tears do we have to cry 
How many sleepless, lonely nights 
To work it out, is it worth it now 
Should we go ahead 
Or should we turn around 
I know I ll see you tomorrow

I'm runnin' down South to bury my head in the ground

Oh, I don't need money and I don't need you
But if you come around I'm gonna bliggidy loo

Always be careful, don't ever feel good
How is J-U-D-G-M-E-N-T

I know I've given up
A hundred times before
But I know a miracle
Is not something to ignore


You take me for a fool
You take me for a fool


I never knew anybody  til I knew you
I never knew anybody  til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours
I never knew anybody  til I knew you
I never knew anybody  til I knew you
And I know when it rains, oh, it pours
And I know I was born to be yours


Are you the only one
Lost in the millions 
Or are you my grain of sand
That's blowing in the wind 

Always take it slow, I'm just a little too bold
I'm growing older than my age
I can't believe, I can't believe that
You've been on my mind
Oh, call it like you see it, I'm a little too early
Let it be, I'm just a puddle of mud
Staining everything I see
That walks all over me


I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it 

Wise men say I'm foolish, I just give 'em all a grin
The wise are prudent, never walking on a limb
I live on stars that burn so bright they close their eyes
Typically I'm weak when I'm a little bit nervous
Oh, you think I'm such a competent fool
I'm telling everyone I know I'm strolling streets


I give it up
You're just a bottle of Coke
I'm just a little too broke to believe it
Count me in
I'm just the grayest drown
And you're the talk of the town, can you believe it 


I just keep on hoping you think
What you think when you thought
That I was gold, and I'm not
But I give you what I got
I'm just a little bit old
When I need to be young
I'm just a little bit young
When I need to be

Yeah, we were young and were so impressed
Yeah, add that girl with the diamond dress
They told me things that I couldn't believe
And now you took it all away from me


I said, "Call on me when you're in trouble"
I got this feelin' that I'm living in a bubble
"Call on me when you're in trouble"
I got this feelin' that I'm living in a bubble

We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy, we don't want your sympathy


You had the money and you had the moves
And I had nothing 'cause I'm born to lose
So are you happy now 
You made a fool of me


They said, "Call on me when you're in trouble"
I got this feelin' that I'm living in a bubble
"Call on me when you're in trouble"
I got this feelin' that I'm living in a bubble


We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy, we don't want your sympathy
We're just wandering, we don't need anything
We don't want your sympathy, we don't want your sympathy


Oh, aren't you the clever one 
Got me falling for your fun
Got me falling for your fun
But when you crawl inside your hole
And count those corners on your stone
Is that what makes you feel human again 
NoneMy house in Budapest, my
My hidden treasure chest
Golden grand piano
My beautiful Castillo

You, ooh, you, ooh
I'd leave it all
I dig my hole, you build a wall
I dig my hole, you build a wall
One day that wall is gonna fall


Gon' build that city on a hill
Gon' build that city on a hill
One day those tears are gonna spill


So build that wall and build it stronger
We'll be there before too long

Gon' build that wall until it's sky
Gon' build that wall until it's done
But now you've got nowhere to run
So build that wall and build it stronger
We'll be there before too long
The Roman king, the Romulus
The precipice, born to change
The final days, the last embrace
Augustus, Nero, taking names
I'm high, then I'm low, low
Stop, then I go, go
Bipolar, oh, oh
Yes, then I'm no, no
My time will come, I promise that
Pull the trigger back, back


Bullet in a gun 
But in the end, my time will come
Like a bullet in a gun
Blood, sweat, and tears to be the one
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun , gun , gun 
Gun , gun , gun , gun 
Bullet in a gun


To make a name, you pay the price
You give your life, no other way
The devil's deal, it comes around
To wear the crown, rise up from the ground

Patience only gets you so far
Blood will get you further
Pain will only make your heart hard
Tossed in fury's weather
Innocence is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me  
For me


Oh, give me strength, and give me peace
Does anyone out there want to hear me 


It's just another downpour, don't let it get the best of you
It's only up from the floor, light everything inside of you
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me
Don't burn out, don't burn out on me


Sadness is my enemy
I fear time will age him gently
Walking by my side for all these years
Seems that we've grown friendly
Happiness is beautiful to see
Won't you box it up for me  
For me

 I don't sleep so well at night
Waiting up and shivering
Heater's gone and money's tight
In this little home that I'm living in


You've gotta live your life
While your blood is boiling
Those doors won't open
While you stand and watch them


Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you

Oh-oh oh-oh oh
What is with you 
Oh-oh oh-oh oh
I've never seen this side of you 


We are all living, till we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be the soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha ching, cha ching, cha ching-a-ling

 I don't sleep so well at night
I'm waiting up and shivering
Our heater's gone and money's tight
This little home that I'm living in


You've got to live your life
While your blood is boiling
These doors won't open
While you stand and watch them


Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
What is with you 
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I've never seen this side of you
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
What is with you 
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh
I've never seen this side of you 


We are all living 'til we grow older
You be the worker, I'll be a soldier
I never hear those sounds that sing to me, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling
I nev r hear those sounds that sing to me, cha-ching, cha-ching, cha-ching-a-ling

Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones
Ay, ay, ay, ay
Canta y no llores
Porque cantando se alegran
Cielito lindo, los corazones
My calloused hands
My crippled wings
My calloused hands, my crippled wings, they bring you in


'Cause I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, whoa
Your crowded hair falls down a narrow hallway


Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, and close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Let it, let it, let it move, let it move, move


Your scribbled masterpiece
And written poetry


'Cause I've been taught if I would just open my hands up to the sky
They'll turn to clouds, whoa
A sky of hands that rains down heavy on us

Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!


My calloused hands
My crippled wings
My calloused hands, my crippled wings, they bring you in

Let it, let it, let it move, let it move
Oh, just forget it, just forget it, oh, close your eyes
I never said it, never said it, oh surprise
Come on let it, let it move, let it move, move
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go


Your scribbled masterpiece
And written poetry

Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!
Oh, woah! Oh, wo-a-oh!


Looking to the lonely telegraph that crept into your room
Listen to the bleating voices of the ones around her tomb


The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing

Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight


They say that London sounds like the city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, you don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do


I can take a picture, you can be a picture
Stitched into the fading black
I can take you home, now you can be a home
And we'll never look on back


The radio is playing, but I can't hear them sing
The people all explaining, but they don't know a thing


Give me a sign, give me a sign
I wanna die tonight


They say that London sounds like the city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
Oh, you don't love me
You don't love me like you say you do
Oh, London sounds like the city of red
All the prisoners wait for a turn to be dead
And I don't want to die
No, I don't want to die
Tonight

Take my word
I promise you, I'll come through
Take my word
I promise you, I'll be true
I'm there for you, ah
I'm there for you, ah
I'm there for you, ah
I promise you, I'll come through
I'm your continual truth

Speak no lies
I just wanna hear the truth
I'm done with all the miracles, except for you
Is it my fault if I'm something of a skeptic 
I've been burnt before, 'cept by you


So take my word
I promise you, I'll come through

Yeah, take my word
I promise you, I'll be true
I'm there for you, ah
I'm there for you, ah
I'm there for you, ah
I promise you, I'll come through
I'm your continual truth
Continual truth


Do pray tell
The beauty that inspires you
Is something of a miracle
You do what you do
Give me faith again 
Give me all the answers
I'll follow you blindly
Pray you don't deceive me

Cool out, cool out


Just before I go
Yes, I know that I'm losing control and
I want to take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control
I know I'm always pacing
And I blame it on the pressure I'm facing
I wanna take things slow
Put my mind in cruise control

I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and


Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out


You're always saying that you read my sign and
Always wishing that I take the time but
You know that's not my speed
Only believe what I can see
I live my life in black-and-white
I know that's not what you would like
That's all I know
I put my mind in cruise control


I'm standing on your front porch saying, "Don't go"
You were lookin' at me wild saying, "Just go home," and


Cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out, stay high, stay fresh, play nice
And just cool out, 'cause baby, I don't think I'm the one for you
So cool out 
So cool out 

There's lights that line these halls
That beckon us to stay
A glimmer in the distance
That gathers all the stray
And when I need it most
It breaks into a song
That runs through all my veins
And helps me to hold on
It was a long night
We ran along into the spotlight
You sang a song that made the children cry
And all the people knew my name
It was a bright light
These lands combine into a great big mass
We sang along to the very last
Oh, the jury stole my fame

And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight
I feel it
Cover up, rain down
We wept on the edge of this town
It's all I want, it's all we want tonight


Oh, you look so alive
D-d-d-did you think that we'd cry tonight 
Oh, did you think we'd cry 
Oh, can you feel my heart 
I think I feel it, too
D-d-d-did you think that we'd die tonight 
Oh, did you think we'd die 


And then we grabbed the sun
And it shined into these eyes
Believe me
None
I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
Mhm, I just knew too much


Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Does that make me crazy 
Possibly


And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are 
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control 


Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

What the hell am I doing here 
I don't belong here


I m a creep
I'm a weirdo
What the hell am I doing here 
I don't belong here


Mm, she s running out the door
She's running out
She's run, run, run, run
Run


Everyone feel peaceful tonight  Peace and love that's what music is about. I don't care if it's corny; peace and love
I suppose
She's supposed to be
Exactly what they want her to be
So pretty and pink
Necklace and ring
Don t be heard, just be seen
But that's not who I am


She said I can feel, I can feel too much
And I wish they'd go away, go away
 Cause it's crushing me, it's crushing me


Don't you know
That you don't have a say 
And the scarlet "A" on your neck
So pretty in red
Eyes are all dead
What they haven't said
Gets stuck in your head
The silence is deafening
And your heart is bleeding out
But they don't care
No, they never cared at all
No, they never cared at all
That's not who I am
D-O-double-G 
Top Dogg, bite 'em all, yeah I'm burn that need up

Lowlife, yo' life, boy, we livin' it up
Takin' chances while we dancin' in the party fo' sho'

Spaceships fly 
Yeah, unapologetic when w  fuck up the night
Fuck up the night
We g tting fucked up tonight

Don't ever say it's over if I'm breathin'
Racin' to the moonlight and I'm speedin'
I'm headed to the stars, ready to go far
I'm star walkin'

She barely knew your name


He was just a city, she's just a dirt road
But that never meant a thing
Running from the country
She needed out, but he held that diamond ring


'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break  this  curse 
Break  this  curse 
She barely knew your name

He was such a worry
No need to hurry
Those streets are slick at night
She would never listen
She left it all and headed towards the light
Oh your eyes look tired
But love was all she knew
Screaming out in agony
She gave her life for you


'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break  this  curse 
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break  this  curse 
She barely knew your name
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I can't sit, oh, I can't talk
I got to leave this town and run to you
Curse these nights that speak your name
I got to leave this town and come to you
Break  this  curse 
Ha, ha, ha, ha
Break  this  curse 
She barely knew your name


It's a, a strange thing
Just a miracle dream
To be at peace with a fling
What if I'm more than crushes 
And moved past more than just lust
To feel it deep inside
Crying out to my trust
It's indescribably pushin' it
My mind is uncertainty
Beside I want a love that's all certain
Beyond a doubt I want to shout it out
I will shout it out to the world
To find a woman with certainty
Being my whole life earnin'
But, my baby, what's burnin' 
Discernin' it comes from the heart
That the mind of the eyes
A dark curtain containin'
Capable collisions of hearts

Here we go 
You and I 
I am me 
And you are mine 
I'mma sing it out 
I play it loud
At the curtain call
Baby, take a bow, woah
Who knew what 
We all want 
Is just a simple situation  
I'mma follow my heart 
It's led me well 
Well, I'm here with you, today


When I first met you, 
I was so short of breath
I stared like a child who 
Who was faking as deaf
You smiled and I laughed 
And you asked me some questions
But baby, all I kept thinkin'
Was taking first kissin' lessons 
Blessings seem to be pourin' 
From right at the start
You searched deep down inside and know to follow your heart 
I followed this path 
It's leading to you
I've arrived at the 'X', baby, tell me what to do 

I've been waiting patiently
I built this tower quietly
And when my well of Wellbutrin is
Running dry of serotonin
I can say things I don't mean
Or maybe it's the truth in me
I feel it building, bubbling up
My t-t-time is up


I'm so  misunderstood 
But I live for this , my money's good 
And I came to win , so step on up 
And I promise you


Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you 
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive and it's not you 
Only one of us
Only one of us gon' make it out alive


I've been making my Gethsemane
Since I was young, my ancestry 
Was marching martyrdom across the
Radadada dumbla plains of Utah 
I can't lie, I've been played
By powerful p ople who get their way
But I, in tim , will climb my mountain
I, in time, will rise

Don't throw my name 'round here like that
You could get us in some trouble
Talking that way and
Monday you got me, that's a fact
You could get me in some trouble
Talking that way and
I don't need nobody


If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark

Dancing in the...
Join me
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby


Most days I'm keeping to myself, living in my little bubble
Throwing my weight and moving my body through the sea
You could come join me
Moving like the weekend
I don't need nobody


If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark
If you ever wanna join me baby, I'll be dancing in the dark


Dancing in the...
Join me
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby
Dancing in the...
Join me baby

I can never leave you when you're lying in the bed
Face to the wall
Eyes locked on the floor
What did you mean by that, what did you mean by that 
Take it as a self invitation
Take it as your own means of salvation
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back


Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

I could never beat it when you needed me the most
The more I try the less you try to come
How could I live like that, how could I live like that 
Take it as a self indication
Take it as your own means of vindication
If I could take it all
If I could take it all back


Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
And if it's too late for deciding
Oh, just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness


Nothing is forgiven unless you want it to be
It's too late for deciding
So just leave it to me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me, stay with me
Stay with me please
Because I'm living, living
Living in the darkness

This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale


I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come


When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's wher  my demons hide, it's wher  my demons hide
Don't get too close, it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide


At the curtain's call, it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

When the days are cold and the cards all fold
And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale


I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come


When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's wher  my demons hide, it's wher  my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide


At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made

I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never heard it
All of our energy
I bring these words to life


We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination

I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun, alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are leaving but I'm changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life


We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life

We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination


Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh

We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation

This is our destination

I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sentinels are cunningly estranging, oh
I think a little about a lot and reach a verdict
You think a lot about a little never hurt at all of our energy
Bring these words to life


We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations

This is our destination


I take me back to '91
I had the love life there, a loaded gun alright
I see the colors of the world are rearranging
The center sin and those are leaving but are changing
All of our energy
I bring these words to life


We stay up late and draw the lines
To every constellation
We live with all our sorrows tied
To age and separation
These are the days of love and life
These are our expectations
We stay up late to live tonight
This is our destination
None
You know how we do


I want a new world without the order
I wanna resurrect and live a little shorter
I want it heavy
I want the fury
I wanna beat it out the judge and the jury


From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside
From the outside, everything looks right
From the outside, from the outside

We are, we are the face of the future
We are, we are the digital heartbeat
We are, we are the face of the future
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital heartbeat
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, digital, digital
We don't wanna change, we just want to change everything

There's dolphins over my head
Swimmin' through my conscience
My working days are over
Heading out to make my way
When darkness is around us
We'll dive into the cavern
Our working days are over
Heading out to make my way


It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us meet
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you


My faith is at adolescent
I've learned myself a lesson
If I hold myself higher
I think it'd get much higher


It's time for us to go to sleep
These bonds will never let us be
This open air is choking me to death
I fill my lungs with you

In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top
It's not what you painted in my head
There's so much there instead of all the colors that I saw
We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess
But I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
In the eyes of a teenage crystallized
Oh, the prettiest of lights that hang the hallways of the home
And the cries from the strangers out at night
They don't keep us up at night
We have the curtains drawn and closed

In the dark, and I'm right on the middle mark
I'm just in the tier of everything that rides below the surface
And I watch from a distance seventeen
And I'm short of the others' dreams of being golden and on top


We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
Leave me to dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream
I wanna dream


I know all your reasons
To keep me from seeing
Everything is actually a mess
But now I am leaving
All of us were only dreaming
Everything is actually a mess


We all are living in a dream
But life ain't what it seems
Oh everything's a mess
And all these sorrows I have seen
They lead me to believe
That everything's a mess

Get me right, all it takes is silent night
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these people flying kites
They seem to live forgotten nights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me


Drive, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh
I, I got my head on aright
I got my people strapped tight
I got my head on aright, oh


Oh, get me right, all it takes is starry nights
I want my eyes to see these lights
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me
Get me right, look at these seagulls in the air
They seem to yell just like we care
Hold, hold, hold on, hold, hold on
But when it comes it goes
I am on my knees, oh, forgive me

I'm holding my breath, holding so tight
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right
I'm in the dark, looking for light
Won't someone please save my life 
Inside, I'm a mess, but I don't let it show
I'm just hanging on, but you'd never know
I smile all day, and cry through the night
Won't someone please save my
Life is fleeting

Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind


A smoldering flame, deep in my heart
Barely a sign, it's barely a spark
Holding on through every night
Won't someon  please save my lif  
I'm crying for help, it's such a clich 
Invisible pain, it's filling each day
I open my mouth and feed you a lie
Won't someone please save
My life is fleeting, no repeating


Dull knives taking my life
A slow burn fire from the inside
Dull knives twisting my spine
They're taking their time, time
'Til I lose my mind


Dull knives ripping from the inside
Spare me the ride

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears


I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused


It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind


Min  is broken, how is yours 
Sure, it helps to h ar the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day..
Easy now
You don t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh, it s laid out for you


Who made you think you weren't good enough 
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren t good enough 
Who made you think that you weren't good enough 
Who made, who made, who made, who made you think that you weren t good enough 

Easy now
You don t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh, it s laid out for you


But am I strong enough 
Oh, am I whole enough 
And do I have enough
To give 
But am I strong enough 
Oh am I whole enough 
And do I have enough
To give 


Easy now
You don t have nothing left to prove
Easy now
Oh it s laid out for you


But am I strong enough 
Oh, am I whole enough 
And do I have enough
To give 
But am I strong enough 
Oh am I whole enough 
And do I have enough
To give 

All my friends are gone, I don't blame them
I guess I'd move on, do the same thing
So I wrote a song to be my lullaby
Sing me to sleep at night, open my third eye


I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch 
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here

I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go


Sometimes I drive a little too fast
Think I'm runnin' from demons of my past
So I wrote a song to help me slow down
Keep my mind straight, but it's a bit late


I'm not gon' lie to you, I miss you so much
Tell me what I did wrong to lose touch 
I'm not gon' lie to you, this has been a hard year
How I wish that you were here


I just need to let it go, waitin' on a miracle
Guess that's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go, turn it down and lay low
It's just the way it goes, easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go , waitin' on a miracle 
Guess that's just the way it goes , easy come, easy go
I just need to let it go , turn it down, and lay low 
It's just the way it goes , easy come, easy go

Emma stood in front of me
Telling me what I'm supposed to be
Jackie loves to run and hide
Give her love, and she will die
Golly me, oh my, oh my
Cross my heart and hope to die
Bourbon streets and bicycles
Holding you in carnivals
Baby, is my love too old for you 
Baby, is my love too old for you 
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you

Dinner bells and loaded gun
Innocence is bound to run
Enemies and playing fun
But don't you touch that golden sun
Innocence and sentiment
It's all I have, it's paying rent


Baby, is my love too old for you 
Emma, I'm for you
Emma, I'm for you
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it
Hell and silence
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Emma I'm for you
Look out for yourself


I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned


Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy-y-y-y-y 

But I'm ready


Your words up on th  wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in th  halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic


Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us 


Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y 

My enemy-y-y-y-y 

Uh, look, okay

Look out for yourself


I wake up to the sounds of the silence that allows
For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searching to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smiling when I turned


Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us

Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy-y-y-y-y

But I'm ready


Your words up on th  wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in th  halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic


Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us 


Oh, the misery
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Spare the sympathy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y

My enemy-y-y-y-y 


Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you


Every single day
Every word you say
Every bond you break
Every single day
I'll be watching you


Oh, can't you see 
You belong to me
How my poor heart aches with every breath you take


Every move you make
Every breath you take
Every vow you make
Every single day
I'll be watching you
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night


I'm the colorless sunrise
That's never good enough
I'm the wind that's in your hair
That ruffles you up
If you can find a reason
You can let me know
I won't blame you
I'll just turn and go


I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night
Coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night


My mind is made up
Nothing could change that
I'm coming home to you
Every night, every night, every night, every night



You take my eyes




He told me that the life of my dreams
Would be promised and someday be mine 

But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead inside 
I, N, V, U
Sprinkled with a little bit of sex appeal
And it's a moment, yeah 

Cold, cold heart 
You must be so confident thinking 
That I'm gonna give you my time 
My patience is waning, is this entertaining 
All I do is sit around and wait for better days 


As I get a little older 
I realize lif  is perspective
L t's start


What else can I do 
None
Run for cover
My sense of fear is running thin
Under cover
Just like a candle in the wind


Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming


Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out

Every morning
I'm staring shadows in the eye
Oh, good morning
Will you just wait until I die 


Tell everybody, tell everybody
Brother, sister, the ending is coming


Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just going to ride it out


Ohh, tell everybody tell everybody
Ohh, tell everybody we are fallen


Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Ohh, we are fallen, we are fallen
Now we're just gonna ride it out


I just want to take it in
Even when your fire runs out
Will you start it up again 
We are fallen
...yesterday
And I'm falling into you

We make the nights side by side today
Outside in this rain has come away
On the side of the road
Took me to your house...



Just for you got the eyes with the broken dreams
And all I ever wanted was a second to breathe a day
Now look at the sea as it calls to you
But only for a second, then it sinks into the deep
I'm so far away
And I'm falling into the sea I'm in the bathroom, looking at me
Face in the mirror is all I need
Wait until the reaper takes my life
Never gonna get me out alive
I will live a billion million lives
Traveling the roads imma take my ride
Will i come back and make it out alive 
I see your face when i close my eyes 
See your face when i close my eyes 

Liquor in my cup
Was it all my fault
I don't want you to lie 
I'll keep your heart in my vault
Was it all my fault 
Was it all my fault 

Was it all my fault 
Bae don't turn the lights out
Gotta remove the photos from iCloud
Bae don't turn the lights out

Still I see your eyes each time that I close mine
I can t see a sunset without seeing your face in my mind
You look so sad
Are you alright 
But now i'm sippin codeine with the sprite
I'm tryna find my high

I m losing all the loneliness that made me feel I wasn t enough
Could this be how two hearts know that they re in love 
In love, In love, In love

Was it all my fault 
Was it all my fault 
Gotta remove the photos from iCloud
There's a whisper, a rumor
Voices in the air outside
Got their eyes on the future
Yeah, the kids are coming up on the ride
Got 'em running in fear, fear, fear
Got 'em running in fear, fear, fear

Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that moves
Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that moves

Roll this cup of deuces
The fuel will keep the fire alive
All the police think we're useless
Yeah, the kids are coming out tonight
Got 'em running in fear, fear, fear
Got 'em running in fear, fear, fear

Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that moves
Lights out
I'm 'fraid of everything that moves
Lights out
Lights out

Lights out
I'm afraid of everything that moves
Lights out
I'm afraid of everything that moves
Lights out
Lights out
I close my eyes so tight I might not realize you're gone
I tell a million stories like I'm old and she's young
It's cold out here at night but I don't mind
I feel the heat creeping up my spine, but it's alright
It's alright


I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh

February seems to be the worst of all my friends
She brings in all the darkness when the year, it just begins
But, oh, it seems so calm at the strangest of times
Loneliness, it seems to be the worst of all her crimes
And I'm alright
It's alright


I close my eyes, shut 'em up so tight
You ask me why I never sleep at night
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh
I play my cards, never play 'em right
I tell the same old stories, tell 'em over twice
It's oh, oh, oh, oh, alright
Oh, oh, oh


Don't you let me go
I'm holdin' on
I will let you know
What's going on
You're the reason why I sing this song
Oh

He's never gonna treat you right, I'm sure
He's never gonna kiss you like he should
He's never gonna tuck you in at night
You've always been afraid to settle down
I don't even blame you cause look how
These boys are now
Promise that I'll make you feel
Like we're on a Ferris Wheel
We're always young and innocent
I promise you when things get hard
Our love will be strong enough
I know we'll last, I'm confident


I don't mean to speak in fairy tales
But we have had some heaven and some hell
And I can only speak for myself
And I'm speechless
You've always been afraid to claim this town
And I don't even blame you 'cause look how
These boys are now


Promise that I'll make you feel
Like we're on a Ferris Wheel
We're always young and innocent
I promise you when things get hard
Our love will be strong enough
I know we'll last, I'm confident

You know I got your number, number all night
I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight


If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right

I'm always on your team, I got your back, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if he treats you right
I wanna put you into the spotlight


If the world would only know what you've been holding back
Heart attacks every night
Oh, you know it's not right


I will follow you way down wherever you may go
I'll follow you way down to your deepest low
I'll always be around wherever life takes you
You know I'll follow you


Call you up, you've been crying, crying all night
You're only disappointed in yourself, alright
Taking those, taking those losses if it treats you right
I wanna take you into the sunlight

Forever young, I want to be forever young
Do you really want to live forever 
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever 
Forever, and ever


Let's dance in style, let's dance for a while
Heaven can wait we're only watching the skies
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Are you gonna drop the bomb or not 


Let us die young or let us live forever
We don't have the power but we never say never
Hoping for the best but expecting the worst
Music's for the sad men


Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever 
Forever, and ever
Forever young, I want to be forever young 
Do you really want to live forever 
Forever, forever youngNone
Get down with the victim
We both know you need them
You're stuck in the middle
Of all irrelevance
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now


When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do 
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you've made it 
Won't ya tell me what to do 
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong

You can't fight the friction, so 
You can't take the pressure, so 
Don't tell me to be strong 
You can't fight the friction
So ease it off


And get into the system
We both know you need one
The tip of the needle
Is taking over you
And your heart is beating
'Cause you know that you gotta
Get out of the middle
And rise to the top now


When you've made it
Won't ya tell me what to do 
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong
When you've made it 
Won't ya tell me what to do 
'Cause I'm playin' it all wrong


You can't fight the friction, so 
You can't take the pressure, so 
Don't tell me to be strong 
You can't fight the friction
So, ease it off

Take a hit of anything
To escape it all, I'm suffocating
A sharpened blade of reality
Sometimes, I wanna hurt me
I know it's hard to hear, but I'm
Waitin' for the new year
Don't wanna waste my life chasin' white
Try to swim towards the light


Comin' up for air in the deepest of the deep ends
I thought I learned it all, but boom, the plot thickens
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Got so tired of feelin' numb
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Well, take a look what I've become
Sleepin' with giants, I'm tip-toein' quietly
Feelin' it all, it's sobriety


Wanna make you proud of me
But slowly, I am killing me
Playing with chemistry
Floating to th  ceiling
Always rock 'n' roll 'til you die, you know, you been flyin'
Now I'm shaking at night, sweating th  sheets out
Grinding my teeth out
But still the world will glamorize it all

Oh-woah
We all scream out
"Give, give it a break"
These walls won't fall
Give, give it a break
Tired of the fire in the fireplace
Tired of the world, find a better place
Now, true...
       
       
       
First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real
Who can you trust 
Who can you trust 
When everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold, gold
Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold
Gold
Gold

First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed

Everything, everything
Everything you touch turns to gold, gold gold

Everything you touch turns to gold-


Gold
Gold


Statues and empires are all at your hands
Water to wine and the finest of sands
When all that you have's turning stale and it's cold
You'll no longer feel when your heart's turned to gold

One, two
One, two, three


First comes a blessing of all that you've dreamed
But then comes the curses of diamonds and rings
Only at first did it have its appeal
But now you can't tell the false from the real

O-o-o-o-o-o-o-oh
NoneNone
One, two, yeah
A one, two, three, four


I'm broke but I'm happy
I'm poor but I'm kind
I'm short but I'm healthy, yeah
I'm high but I'm grounded
I'm sane but I'm overwhelmed
I'm lost but I'm hopeful, baby


And what it all comes down to
Is that everything's going to be fine, fine, fine
Because I've got one hand in my pocket
And the other one is giving a high five


I feel drunk but I'm sober
I'm young and I'm underpaid
I'm tired but I'm working, yeah
I care but I'm restless
I'm here but I'm really gone
I'm wrong and I'm sorry, baby

Can hold a gun
And hold your heart
Can put out fires
And make 'em start
Skin and bones
And flesh and blood
With all this nerve
How did we get this numb
Cus they can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Ooh hands
Hands
Woooo hands
Oh hands
Cause they can love
Or they can take
They can fight up
Until they save
They can break the world
They can change it too
Ooh hands
Doesn't matter
Who you love
All that matters
Is your love
I've been watching news
And seeing all this hate
Tell me is it wrong
To want a little change
They can hurt
Or they can heal
They can give back
Or they can steal
They can break the world
Or they can change it too

Oh, hang me up to dry
You wrung me out
Too, too, too many times
Oh, hang me up to dry
Oh, I'm pearly like the whites
The whites of your eyes

Try to hear my voice
You can leave, now it's your choice
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back


I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right
Can nobody hear me 
I've got a lot that's on my mind
I cannot breathe
Can you hear it too 
You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me

Try to hear my voice

You kiss and you kiss, and you love and you love
You've got a history list, and the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me, me, me, me
From the floor to the floor, and the sky to the sky
You've got to love and adore and the rest is awry
But if you're warm, then you can't relate to me


I said it before, I won't say it again
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right

Leave your shoes at the door, baby
I am all you adore, lately
Come with me and we will run away!

I try to hear my voice
Ya can leave, now it's your choice
But maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right

You kiss and you kiss, oh, you love and you love
You got a history list, the rest is above
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me, ha
Now from the floor to the floor and the sky to the sky
You got to love and adore, the rest is awry
If you're warm, you can't relate to me

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you  Where are you 
Oh, now that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, woah


I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it
I guess I'm just down on my luck a bit, shakin' me out of it

With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you  Where are you 
Oh, now that I need you most and
A heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down


Now, I can't go a single day without thinking of the words I'd say
And I can't do a single thing without thinking of you, thinking of you


Now I'm just left with the pieces to put back together




With my heart upon my sleeve
My head down low, I still feel broken
Down upon my knees
With my head down low and I still feel broken
Where are you  Where are you 
Oh, now that I need you most and
My heart upon my sleeve, broken down, down, down, down
I know when my day will come
Go back to the place that I came from
Lookin' back, will I think that I did it right 
I still don't sleep at night
I got these symphonies stuck in my head
And they don't leave
Fillin' up the silence with these notes
I don't want them to go


Ghosts follow me around these days
Haunting my head and house
My mind is crazy loud
But I won't give in to it
Take it all in stride

This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the high r ground


I've got that golden gun
I was born as the s venth son
Everything comes with conditions
Everyone's got their dirty dishes
I've got these memories
Stuck in my head, and they won't leave
Filling up my treetops with these crows
I wish that they would go


This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher
This life is such a ride
I live until I die
I walk into the fire
I'm searching for the higher ground
What a life
I live until I die
Won't fail unless I try
I'm searching for the higher ground

Look at the moon
It looks gold
I think it put me in a chokehold, ooh
Alleviate my deep pride
I think it stabbed me in my strong side, ooh
Just when I thought I got it all
You take it all, you take it all, you take it all, ooh


Just give me love
Too much to ask 
I want the one with the night on a flask, ooh
I think my heart, it's full of ooze
My brain is sparking like a burnt out fuse, ooh


I think my heart belongs to the sea
Let it sink to the deep


We are just a few with a hole inside our chests
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Dancing to the drums of the beats inside their hearts
Oh, drown oh, plug me up
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
Just one more time before I go
I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Hey, Mr. Cage Man
Let me get a fresh breath
Cherry bomb, headstrong
I could fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate Man
Shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go long
Throwin' me a sharp right
It's not a picture-perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus
Hey, Mr. Safe Man
Hustle me an okay
I could slide, take a dive
Take it for the home team
Hey, Mr. Post Man
Slip me one more green note
I've been low, hit the floor
Looking just to make broke
Humble

1-2-3
Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Way 


I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a trigger with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin' this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact I'm downin' this
D'USS  with my boo bae tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that tussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods 
I get way too petty once you let me do the extra
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, now you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know


And be humble
Sit down
And be humble
Sit down
And be humble
Sit down
And be humble

Oooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh
Oooh-ooh
Just one more time
Before I go, I'll let you know
That all this time I've been afraid
Wouldn't let it show
Nobody can save me now, no
Nobody can save me now
Baby, don't you let me go
Don't leave me 'cause you love me
I can see it in your sigh
And your hollowed-out goodbye
I know you feel it in my shaking voice at night
I hope it burns into your feathered alibi

I am just a sailor and...
I know I took the path
That you would never want for me
I know I let you down, didn't I 
So many sleepless nights
Where you were waiting up on me
Well, I'm just a slave unto the night

I gave you hell through all the years

So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you


Don't tell me that I'm wrong
I've walked that road before
And left you on your own
And please believe them when they say
That it's left for yesterday
And the records that I play
Please forgive me for all I've done


So I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my life
I bet my life, I bet my life on you
I, I bet my
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get no satisfaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
And I can't get no, I can't get no


When I'm driving in my car
And that man comes on the radio
He's telling me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to spark my imagination
I can't get no - oh no, no!
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say
C'mon now


I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get girl reaction
'Cause I try and I try and I try and I try
I can't get no, I can't get no


When I'm watching my TV
And that man comes on to tell me
About how white my shirts can be
Well he can't be a man, 'cause he doesn't smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no, no no no
Hey, hey, hey, that's what I say

We could be strangers in the night
We could be passing in the shadows
We couldn't be closer if we tried
When we're caught in the headlights
We could be faces in the crowd
We could be passin' in the shadows
Lovin' the risk of bein' found
When we're caught in the headlights


Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust

I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you


I was a vacant alibi
Trading the truth in for a lie, oh
We were the essence of desire
And we're caught in the headlights


Dangerous
Your love is always dangerous
And now I'm lost in us
We're livin' in a lie of trust


I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you 
To do with you 
I don't know why
But I guess it's got somethin' to do with you
To do with you

One day, I'll change my ways
Till then, I'm stuck in this space
Shut down and hiding my face
Tuned out and losing my faith


Stand up, tired of being the victim
You only on the outs, if you with them
Only hurts if you give 'em credence 
Give 'em reasons 
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination

There are times when I don't like myself
I believe all the things that they say about me 
I wanna love myself, just lik  everyone  lse
But there are times when I don't like myself


This life is beating me down
But karma is coming around
Tongue-tied, and you got the best of me
A nightmare that's filling my dreams


Stand up, tired of being a victim
You only on the outs if you with 'em
Only hurts if you give 'em credence 
Give 'em reasons 
They're not better than you
They're just a figment of imagination


There are times when I don't like myself 
I believe all the things that they say about me 
I wanna love myself, just like everyone else
But there are times when I don't like myself

Did your mother like your Sunday dress 
Astrology eradicates
So what, so what 


It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
I'm not a lover let me be
For our hearts to bind or be set free
So what, so what 
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, you could show me
I could show you, so much, so much


It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind
It's all that we've got
It's all that we can give
Believe it or not
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind

Took your heart, took your hand
Promise you all that I had
Hopin' that you understand
Far from a perfect man


'Cause, honey, it's been a hard year
It seem like we're goin' nowhere
Cryin' inside your bedroom
Baby, I know it's not fair


Lay with me for one more night
I promise you, I'll make it right


I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you, you, you
Every night, I'll make it up to you


I know you don't understand
The vices that follow a man
And in your eyes I can see
The places that you'd rather be

I'm never alone, I look at my phone
If I call you up, you're never at home
I love you all the time
I'm fueled up and high, a man among guys
A smile on my face, no reason to cry
I love you all the time


I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay


Ce soir c'est le soir et toi avec moi
Et tu viens me voir, tr s bien ouh la la
I love you all the time
Tu ne r ponds pas, ah dis-moi pourquoi
This ain't au revoir, together voil 
I love you all the time


I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I can tell you're gonna take your love away
I can tell by that look in your eye
Kind of look that roams around, and sees another guy
I would beg you if I thought it would make you stay

When I wake up, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who wakes up next to you
When I go out, yeah, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who goes along with you
If I get drunk, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who gets drunk next to you
And if I haver, hey, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's havering to you


But I would walk five hundred miles
And I would walk five hundred more
Just to be the man who walked a thousand miles
To fall down at your door


When I'm working, yes, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's working hard for you
And when the money comes in for the work I do
I'll pass almost every penny on to you
When I come home , oh, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who comes back home to you
And if I grow old, well, I know I'm gonna be
I'm gonna be the man who's growing old with you

What's wrong with me 
Is there somebody else inside my head
That doesn't want me to be happy 
I know my rights, I live until I die
I've got this bed
Each night I go to sleep and dream
I'm swimmin' in the deep end
You're my buoy and I'm sinkin'
Life flies by me but I'm thinkin'

You saved my life and now I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around


They tellin' me, that I should love myself
Sometimes I fail
But then you hit me like a whiplash
Yellin' in my corner
She's a wild one, yes, I should warn ya'
Life flies by me every mornin'


You saved my life and now I'm happy
'Cause finally I feel I got it all
Started out with nothing at all
And even when I might fall down
I know my luck come back around


They tell me to write a paragraph of everything I love about me
Write a paragraph and send it in the mail
To a future me, that's trying desperately to start a family
Teach them to love themself
Teach them to love themself
Teach them to love themself

About time for anyone telling you
Off for all your deeds
No sign the roaring thunder
Stopped in cold to read 


I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath 
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death

So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low


A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry
A son of a stepfather
A son of a, I'm so sorry


No lies and no deceiving
Man is what he loves
I keep tryin' to conceive that
Death is from above 
I get mine and make no excuses
Waste of precious breath 
The sun shines on everyone
Everyone, love yourself to death


So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
You'll never be loved 'til you ve made your own
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
You never know the top till you get too low

Welcome to the land of hire
I hope you brought the right attire
The crippled man is waiting at the door
He said, "Your eyes are much too bright"
"The things you say are never right"
"The sins of all the world lie on your head"
So when you see me look the other way
'Cause oh, oh, lately all I do is play
All the glasses in the world say, "Come with me"


I need a minute to get my head straight
Just to hit it before it's too late
Innocent, considering my middle name is Shake My Body
Take a sin, it's Ritalin, I shimmy and I shake my body
Welcome to the land of fail
I hope you brought your soul for sale
The greeter's still at home, I think he died
The land of smash and fairy tale
The truth of life is close to hell
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed
{Verse 1]
Here I stand on the wall
The blood is on my hands, the blood is on my hands
Here you stand on the wall
The blood is on your hands, the blood is on your hands


Take me from this place
I'm wide awake, I'm wide awake


Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
Whoa...

There's no secrets here
Um,
So, I u  I underwent, uh, a vocal surgery a month ago, uh, for my vocal chords

And I m speaking, which is good
But, uh 
*Crowd cheers*

4 AM, beside myself
And what I think of mental health
All the things that worry me
All the things you don't believe
I've been told just what to do
Where to look and point my view
All the things that I could be
I think I learned in therapy


Am I just a shadow you drew 


It comes back to you
It comes back to you
All the things that you had lost
Will find their way to you
It comes back to you
It comes back to you
Looking back into the past
And I can see it through


It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you, oh
It comes back to you

She could always hear every word they say
Everybody walks like they just know the way
Every single day holding back the tears
She'd never say a word 'cause there's nobody that hears


It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind, mind

Mine is broken, how is yours 
Sure, it helps to hear the news and political discourse
Fear, that is what he felt
Every single day as all the boys would play
Don't you dar  be weak, emasculat d freak
Last up on the fence, tell me, where's the sense 


It's okay to be not okay
It's just fine to be out of your mind
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind


I don't want this body, I don't want this voice
I don't wanna be here, but I guess I have no choice
Just let me live my truth, that's all I wanna do
Baby, you're not broken, just a little bit confused


It's okay to be not okay 
It's just fine to be out of your mind 
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind 
It's okay to be not okay 
It's just fine to be out of your mind 
Breathe in deep, just a day at a time
'Cause it's okay to be out of your mind 

So this is what you meant
When you said that you were spent
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit
Right to the top
Don't hold back
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's time to begin, isn't it 
I get a little bit bigger, but then, I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand 
That I'm never changing who I am
So this is where you fell
And I am left to sell
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell
Right to the top

That I'm never changing who I am

I'm sorry, mother, I'm sorry, I let you down
Well, these days I'm fine; oh, these days I tend to lie
I recommend the train, just by the side of Amsterdam
Stuck on my left brain, just by the side of the Tin Man
If I was your last hope, considering I'm broke
Then we're doomed
Let's all just clear the room


I don't ever wanna let you down
I don't ever wanna leave this town
'Cause after all
This city never sleeps at night

It's just another day
It's just another year
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am
If I recover, will you take me back again 
I'm just another, trying hard to fit right in
But the photographs remind me of who I used to be
If only I could go back when I, I was me
I'll try hard to make this ride
I'll try hard to win this fight
"One step at a time", they say
"One trip, and you're back that way"
I don't recognize these eyes
I don't recognize these hands
Please believe me when I tell you
That this is not who I am

I never called you and now it's too late
To say all the words that I've wanted to say
The doctor said, "Oh, there's a fight up ahead"
I should've been there by your hospital bed
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
No, I haven't got the words to say


Oh, how I wish I was a better friend
Before it was too late
I wish that I would've been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend


I wasn't there when you said your goodbye, and I
Replay in my mind 'bout a thousand times
I wasn't ther  for those rivers you cried
I was always too busy, no, I didn't mak  the time
So it rains every day, oh, it rains every day
No, I haven't got the words to say


Oh, how I wish I was a better friend
Before it was too late
I wish that I would have been there in the end
I wish I was a better friend

I love you, you
Running back oh, back to, back to you, you, you, you
I see your anger and hate and I hear ya say, say, say
Let me hear you out at night
And after that I hope you're bulletproof
Then that's okay


Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

 Tomorrow, oh, today here comes the rain
I don't want to, I don't wanna explode, I don't want to explode
When I see your anger awaits
I will never say I 
Say, say, say  but I, but I thought I'm bulletproof
And that's okay


Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well


I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well


Oh, I wanna see you smile again
After all, I think we've fallen to the bottom
Oh, I wish you well

Well, I won't back down
No, I won't back down
You can stand me up at the gates of hell
But I won't back down


No, I'll stand my ground
Won't be turned around
In a world that keeps on draggin' me down
Gonna stand my ground
And I won't back down

I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down


Well I know what's right
I got just one life
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around
But I stand my ground
And I won't back down


I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down




I won't back down
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out
I won't back down
Hey, I will stand my ground
And I won't back down
No, I won't back down
No, I won't back downI'm still a friend though, I might kill my ex I still love him though..
I rather be in jail than have friends. Why u gotta do this like his new girlfriend will be the next one for me that I will come and get you. Nah but TRIPPIN' killin doesn't worth what you want cuz' you will never be satisfied
Your heart
Your heart


Walking out into the dark
Cutting out a different path, led by a beating heart 
All the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart 


The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path upon the ground
You ran into the night you can't be found 

This is your heart
Can you feel it  Can you feel it 
Pumps through your veins
Your heart, your heart
This is your heart
Can you feel it  Can you feel it 
Pumps through your veins
Your heart, your heart
This is your heart
Can you feel it  Can you feel it 
Pumps through your veins
Your heart


Your heart
Your heart


Walking out into the dark
Cutting out a different path, led by a beating heart 
All the people of the town cast their eyes right to the ground
In matters of the heart 


The night was all you had
You ran into the night from all you had
Found yourself a path upon the ground
You ran into the night you can't be found 

Sometimes in our lives
We all have pain, we all have sorrow
But if we are wise
We know that there's always tomorrow


Lean on me when you're not strong
I'll be your friend, I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on


Please swallow your pride
If I have things you need to borrow
For no one can fill those of your needs
That you won't let show


You just call on me, brother, when you need a hand
We all need somebody to lean on
I just might have a problem that you'll understand
We all need somebody to lean on


Lean on me when you're not strong
And I'll be your friend I'll help you carry on
For it won't be long
'Til I'm gonna need somebody to lean on

Take a look inside
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no
I'll beat around the bush
I've got nothing but time, oh, no, oh, no


You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got


Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run

So this is what it feels like
I'll give you the last word
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright
Now if this is the town, oh this is the place
If you are the one to give disgrace a name
Then so be it


You've got me holding on to nothing
But nothing's all I've got


Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Leave me, leave me, I'mma shut it all down
You've got a tendency to bring a man down
I give up, I give up!
You've got to get a gun to make a woman run
Oh take my car, oh take my house
I never liked that beat-up motor mouth
And, oh, it looks so warm tonight
Just like a stranger in the candlelight

There's so much on my mind, I don't know where to start
It's that light in your eye filling up the dark
Though I lost myself, I know it's not the end
You're my shooting star, you make my heart ascend


La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la

I know that we're far from where we need to be
But the world wasn't made in just one day
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong
You're my shooting star, we're flying high above


La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Just levitate, just levitate
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
La-la, la-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la, la-la-la
When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith
I don't know where to turn
To bend my mind as the silver gate
You lead me on my way
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom
Baby I'm blessed to be here
Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh


And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a moment
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you


Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush 
I just want you, skip the mush
Baby, be beautiful
'Cause you're a living musical
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa
Oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh, whoa


She was coughing on the coolers as she asked for my number
I was living in a dream, feelings roll down like thunder
I never met my match, melodic melodies mumble
A cocky young thing meets a girl and I stumble
For the first time in my life I don't know where to start
With a brush in my hand I don't know when it's art
When I laugh she must smile, when I smile she must laugh
Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path 

It all begins with a look in the eyes
That goes beyond the body into
Feelings you tried to forget all about, a sudden attraction
Between two with a few of the mind that distracts
Of the stars, that it builds, but it flies to the bottom

Blessed to just bask in your presence, ooh


And it's unexplainable, uncontainable
It's hard to be asked to have the confidence enough to move
My lips and speak
My eyes to yours
We connect for a mom nt
It seems to be a lifetime

I wish I had a lif time
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you, ooh
I wish I had a lifetime
To capture every moment of you
Every moment of you


Captivating every sense
Exhilarating, feelings dance
I'm just a fool
For a pretty girl with confidence, oh
Who am I to beat the bush

Is it possible that I'd go for a girl in my path 

Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely
Sometimes, I can get a little
I can get a little lonely


Some nights I get a little lonely
It's even when there's people all around me
Sometimes I get a little anxious
'Cause these pills don't work the way the doctor played it

I'm startin' to spin, needles and pins
Right on the brim, hand on a limb, takin' it in
Sleep it away, life in a day, no day in a life
Mixin' it up, checkin' it twice
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life


Oh, love 
Have mercy 
On me 
And keep me company 
I said oh, love 
Have mercy 
On me 
And keep me company 
I said 


Sometimes, I smile to keep things easy
I hide in corners, hope that no one sees me


So I'm playin' the role, ridin' the bull, stuck in a hole
Takin' a bow, lookin' so proud
Look at me now, talkin' about pills in my mouth
Under the tongue, isn't it fun 
Tryin' to breathe, startin' to seize
Lights, camera, action and scene
Story of my life, oh-oh

Take me on a whim
It's not the sun that provides us
It's not the moon that divides us
I can barely swim
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again


Stand up when you hear your name
Because I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole, but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away

Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground
Time to take it over
Look how far we've come
Some were never meant to come around
Some were never meant to leave the ground


I've been painted gin
It's not the color I came in
It's not the shirt that I stain in
Hang me on a limb
And the current's coming in
And the current's coming in again


Stand up when you hear your name
'Cause I think that we're the same
We've got the same old hands
We've made the same old plans
Bail out to the yellow raft
It's got a hole but we can last
We'll watch until it fades away
His palms are sweaty
Knees weak, arms are heavy
There's vomit on his sweater already
Mom's spaghetti
He's nervous, but on the surface..
Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause


Wait, all this time that I have spent away
Makes me think that I might be okay
The kiss of death will have to wait
My head is holding on to all those things you said
You taught me to be strong and get through it
The mist of darkness in my head


Oh, dig my shallow grave
'Cause it's not me you'll save
'Cause I'm a lost cause
I'm a lost cause
A lost, lost cause


Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found
You are here to make it safe and sound
Oh, we can make it out alive
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin
Nothing really matters in the end
As long as you are with me, friend

It's been a long time comin , comin'
Seeming like we all been runnin', runnin 
Feeling like the wild west, gunnin', gunnin'
Listen to our elders shunnin', shunnin'
Flipping on the news beat talkin', talkin'
All about the problems, shockin', shockin 
We put on our headphones walking, walking
We put on our headphones


Where did we all go wrong 
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong 

All we see is faces, color, color
All the other races, other, other
Why can t you just be my brother, brother 
We don't have to kill one another, kill one another
All around the world, we are one, we are one
All around the world, we are one


So where did we all go wrong 
Love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong 
Love, love, love

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love

Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Lo-lo-lo-love, love, love
Where did we all, where did we all go wrong 


'Cause we got the same blood, blood
We got the same blood, blood
Will it be enough, 'nough 
Will it be enough 
We got the same heartbeat
We're living for the same dream
We got the same bloodstream
Where did we all go wrong 
Woo

I see it now, you're flyin' in the fast lane
Don't stop now, you're livin' for the octane
Not some cry just for the attention
Not some low, hopin' for ascension


All my life, tryin' just to touch you
All my life, lookin' in the rearview
Take me now, I'm standin' with my open
Hands drawn out, prayin' for an omen
I'm not sure where this is goin'
I'm not sure what the stars are showin'
All my life, tryin' just to touch you
All my life, lookin' in the rearview
Oh, you look so far away


Love of mine, give me attention
Love of mine, make this connection
If I said you were all that I had to liv  for
Would you run away from me  


Come on now, come a little closer
Don't back down, lookin' for the closer
Not some try, lookin' for a mention
Not some lie, broken intervention

I see it now, you're flyin' in the fast lane

Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again


Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again


However far away, I will always love you
However long I stay, I will always love you
Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you


Whenever I'm alone with you, you, you, you
You make me feel like I am free again

Whatever words I say, I will always love you
I will always love you
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watchin' them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
But now it's 'bout time to raise up and petition
All my life been sittin' at the table
Watching them kids, they're living in a fable
Looks, luck, money and never left a'wishin'
Now it's 'bout time to stand up and petition


'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine

I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
No, I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision
I'm not scared of what you're gonna tell me
And I'm not scared of the beast in the belly
Fill my cup with endless ambition
And paint this town with my very own vision


'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
I am the machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
'Cause I've been wondering
When you gonna see I'm not for sale
I've been questioning
When you gonna see I'm not a part of your machine
Not a part of your machine
I am the machine
All around me are familiar faces
Worn-out places, worn-out faces
Bright and early for their daily races
Going nowhere, going nowhere
And their tears are filling up their glasses
No expression, no expression
Hide my head, I wanna drown my sorrow
No tomorrow, no tomorrow


And I find it kind of funny
I find it kind of sad
The dreams in which I'm dying
Are the best I've ever had
I find it hard to tell you
I find it hard to take
When people run in circles
It's a very, very
Mad world, mad world


Children waiting for the day they feel good
Happy birthday, happy birthday
And to feel the way that every child should
Sit and listen, sit and listen
Went to school and I was very nervous
No one knew me, no one knew me
Hello, teacher, tell me what's my lesson
Look right through me, look right through me
NoneMitula - Sunflower - thunder MIX 
When you're down on your luck
I take them hands and I turn it up
When you're face to the floor
I turn the dial, turn it up more
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me too  Ooh


I believe  in the cause 
I'm pound-for-pound, baby, turn it on
A million calls will never do, I never get enough of you
I never get enough of you

You are my Monday, you're the best day of the week
So underrated and a brand new start
Don't care what all the kids say
You've got the key to my heart, ooh


When you call  on the phone 
I never let you hear the dial tone 
I believe  in your touch 
I know I can be a little much
I'm there for you
Will you be there for me, too  Ooh


You are my Monday , you're the best day of the week 
So underrated  and a brand new start 
Don't care what all the kids say 
You've got the key to my heart, ooh




You could be the one that I've been waiting all my life for
You could be the key to lead me up into the highest floor
Give me lovin', keep me goin' 'til the midnight hour
Bring me up, lift me up to your rainbow tower
Your rainbow tower
My Monday, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo 
My Monday
My Monday, doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo
Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in 
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in 
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me 
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared 
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest 
Do I have to run and hide  
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside 

Oh, the mouth of the river 
Oh, the mouth of the river 

Oh, the mouth of the river
I wanna live a life like that
Live the life of the faithful one
Wanna bow to the floor
With everybody else wanna be someone
I wanna make some love
I don't want no enemies
Oh, it's the curse of the man
Always living life, living life, living just to please
Oh, the mouth of the river
And the wrath of the giver
With the hands of a sinner
Oh, the mouth of the river 
Oh, the mouth of the river 
And the wrath of the giver 
With the hands of a sinner 
Oh, the mouth of the river

I took a walk on a Saturday night
Fog in the air just to make my mind seem clear
Where do I go from here 
I see my breath pushing steam through the air
Shaking hands run through my hair
My fears, where do I go from here 
Is it my fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other

Walking down to the water's edge
Asking why I'm here instead of home
Now I stand alone
I stop to stare at the ocean side
I'm breathing in just to fill inside with peace
Like you were here with me


Is it my fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other


Oh, it's on the warmest night
It's in the brightest light
It's when the world is moving
Oh, it's in the faintest cry
It's in the lover's eyes
Is when I need you most
And don't you know 


Is it my fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
My fault, is it my fault 
We've been missing each other
We've been missing each other
Can I wish on a star for another life 
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons


I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life 
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life  My life


I could run from it all, but I'd only get lost
Oh, I've walked on the bridge that I shouldn't have crossed
And I find myself a user
Oh, I wake every day with addictions to feed
They all call me a friend, but I'll never be freed
From the face of a faithless future


I'm trying to be somebody else
I'm finding it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do


I'm running out of my mind
Is this really my life 
I'm running out of time
Is this really my life  My life

Can I wish on a star for another life 
'Cause it feels like I'm all on my own tonight
And I find myself in pieces
There are pills on the table and a thought in my head
And I walk through the halls where I used to be led
My heart is filled with reasons

I'm tryin' to be somebody else
I'm findin' it hard to love myself
I've wanted to be somebody new
But that is impossible to do

I'm runnin' out of my mind
Is this really my life 
I'm runnin' out of time
Is this really my life  My life

These years pass by and I'm growin' older
And I think of you, and all we've made it through
Some have passed away, there's no words to say
No second tries, is this my life 
And I think of you

I'm runnin' out of my mind
Is this really my life 
I'm runnin' out of time
Is this really my life  My life
Will you hold the line
When every one of them has given up and given in  Tell me
In this house of mine
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
Will the stars align 
Will Heaven step in  Will it save us from our sin  Will it 
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
That's the price you pay
Leave behind your heart and cast away
Just another product of today
Rather be the hunter than the prey
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a
Natural
A beating heart of stone
You gotta be so cold
To make it in this world
Yeah, you're a natural
Living your life cutthroat
You gotta be so cold
Yeah, you're a natural

Something about the way that you walked into my living room
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
But still you, still you want me
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics, and deficits
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
But still you, still you want me


Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me 

There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
And still you, still you want me
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
And still you, still you want me


Oh, I always let you down
You're shattered on the ground
But still, I find you there
Next to me
And oh, stupid things I do
I'm far from good, it's true
But still, I find you
Next to me 


Oh
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it 
So thank you for taking a chance on me
I know it isn't easy
But I hope to be worth it 
None
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in
I'm not giving in


Well, it's time to start the show
I lost my heart and lost my soul
And now it's time that you won't know
I lost my mind and lost my soul


Mm, not giving in
I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in
Ooh, I'm not giving in, yeah


This time, I'm gonna be stronger I'm not giving in
This time, I'm gonna be stronger, no, I'm not giving in


Waste my time which makes things worse
Lost in mine, my love is cursed
Time to make these things feel right
Woah, let's start this show for one last time



Who knows how long I've been awake now 
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
They keep calling me
Beckoning 
Who knows what's right  The lines keep getting thinner
My age has never made me wise
But I keep pushing
On and on
And on and on

 There's nothing left to say now
  There's nothing left to say now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 There's nothing left to say now
  There's nothing left to say now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now


Below my soul, I feel an engine
Collapsing as it sees the pain
If I could only shut it out

I've come too far to see the end now
Even if my way is wrong
And I keep pushing
On and on and on and on


 There's nothing left to say now
  There's nothing left to say now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 There's nothing left to say now
  There's nothing left to say now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now
 I'm giving up, giving up, hey, hey, giving up now

The way they look at me
I know exactly
What they talk about
When I'm not around
Got no time for that
As a matter fact
Every day's my birthday
Oh, I hope you heard me


Take a look outside, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy
Take a real good look, it's a beautiful day, yeah
Yeah, it's a beautiful day, yeah
I'm gonna keep it that way, that way, ayy


So spend your hours on
What you think I've done wrong
I know I'm in your mind
I've been here way too long
I want to spend my life
With those who've done me right
Your heart is frozen over
I'm a four-leaf clov r

There she goes in front of me
Take my life and set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road is at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today

It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
But not today, not today
There she goes in front of me
Take my life, set me free again
We'll make a memory out of it
Holy road was at my back
Don't look on, take me back again
We'll make a memory out of it
We finally fall apart
And we break each other's hearts
If we wanna live young, love
We better start today
It's gotta get easier and easier somehow
'Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
Oh, easier and easier somehow
Oh, I'm calling, I'm calling
And it isn't over unless it is over
I don't wanna wait for that
It's gotta get easier and easier

Don't cry mother dear, your boy has left you for a couple years
He's packed his bags, packed in his courage
Put away his fears and stepped into the unknown
And postponed all complications, yeah
A kiss goodbye and an upset stomach sends me on my way
What I believe, it gets me by, it gets me through the days
Tears fall and puddles form and days without an end
Determination never building, the war has just begun


And it's 1, 2, 3, 4, boys are marching out to war
4, 3, 2, 1, they won't stop 'til it's all done
And it's a left, right, steadfast
Fast to the field with their destiny sealed
Right, left, two-step, off to the plane and the men come home


Oh, oh, don't you cry for me
Oh, oh, I'm coming home to your arms


1, 2, 3, 4, take the lead and I'll follow you
You're the man with the plan, I'm the pawn in your hand
Piece to be played, sacrifice to be made
It's my fate in your hands
With my brothers by my side, form a line, shoulders tight
I will push the right, oh will you push the left-right 
If one man falls, they don't move till he's up
A one-man unit at the wrist, our handcuff
It's handcuff

Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio, Ohio
Walter White!
Feel the Griddy
I know that one day
I'll be that one thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day


Birds outside
Will sing me a song tonight
I know that it's right on time, time 
Life flies by
The moon and the midnight sky
Is guidin' me to your side, side

I know that one day
I'll be that one thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day


Can we run away
To a place that children play
In the grassy fields, fields 
I know they'r  tellin' you things that you put in your head, head
Promis  you that you are better off without them


I know that one day
I'll be that one thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day
One  day
I'll be that one  thing
That makes you happy
I know I'll keep you laughin'
Your sun on a cloudy day 
The feel of a perfect wave
That's crashin' upon your face
Yeah, I know that one day, one day

Oh, pretty baby, you're my motivator
Got me changing my words and my behavior
Pretty lady, you're my operator
Got me dialing your number just to hear ya


Tell me the things that you want
I give you all that I've got
Open your eyes, then you will see


It's just you and me
Only
Throwing out the key
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me
Only
Listen to you breathe
Just living in a dream
It's just you and me


My disaster, you're my only answer
You got me thinking that I could be a master
Pretty baby, you're my heavy ocean
Weigh me down and give me your devotion

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world


I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something


Now take it in, but don't look down...
'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

If you love somebody
You better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Take it in, but don't look down


'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world


I've tried to cut these corners
Tried to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, well
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause
I've traveled all this way for something


Take it in, but don't look down


'Cause I'm on top of the world, hey
I'm on top of the world, hey
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile, hey
Been holding it in for a while, hey
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

If you love somebody
Better tell them while they're here 'cause
They just may run away from you
You'll never know quite when, well
Then again, it just depends on
How long of time is left for you
I've had the highest mountains
I've had the deepest rivers
You can have it all, but life keeps moving

Now take it in but don't look down...


'Cause I'm on top of the world
I'm on top of the world
Waiting on this for a while now
Paying my dues to the dirt
I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world


I've tried to cut these corners
Try to take the easy way out
I kept on falling short of something
I could've gave up then, but
Then again, I couldn't have 'cause

Now take it in, but don't look down...

I've been waiting to smile
Been holding it in for a while
Take you with me if I can
Been dreaming of this since a child
I'm on top of the world

You've got me feeling like a pantomime
That's why I only love you part time
It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"
You got me feeling like a paradigm
Your friends all want me in the meantime
It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed

You left me, baby, for another man
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan
It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"
He's got religious with the rhinestones
Takes care of business on his cellphone
It's just a matter of "Oh, don't touch me
Don't you dare touch me no more"
Hey, you got all the money, honey
Your eyes are looking runny and red
Hey, you think all your friends are funny
But all your friends are way overfed
If you've gotta go, I won't stop you
You'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah"
You've made it easy for the both of us"
If he's got a chance to his mode
He'll hear me singing you
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah"
You've made it easy for the both of us

I had a dream that I lost everything 
All that I'd worked for was gone
Goodness me 
But I felt the same as I do right now
Everything is meaningless
At least that's how it feels 


Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind 

I've got so much to be happy about 
I'm always focused on things that amount to nothing
Yeah, I think I'm a little depressed 
Everything is m aningless
At least that's how it feels 


Try as I might, I can't g t no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind 
No, ohh, peace of mind
Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind 


But then you came into my life
You made me laugh for the first time
In a real long while


Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind
I try every time, but can't get no peace of mind 
No, ohh, peace of mind
Try as I might, I can't get no peace of mind 


Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do
Do-do-do-do, do-do-do-do-do-do-do

Oh, my dear it's a pistol whip to my
Broken head, and the stars are spinning
So I pick one up and put it on my shoulder
Look, look, look
You're a world class case, I'll punch my stomach
All the people see me rolling over
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Pace, pace, pace

Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo


I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly
I can see clearly, I can see clearly what you mean


Shadows soar, and breathing heavy
I fall four flights up, halfway steady
With my hand on my shoulder, oh, with the star like I told ya
Look, look, look
I'mma take ten steps and close my eyes
Turn around and draw to my surprise
I clutch my heart and scream, "Yeehoo!"
Pace, pace, pace


Pistol whip, I'm bleeding a bit
But, I'll pop your bubble, let's talk it over
Count your loss of being a killer
Star's on my shoulder, holding you over
Oh-o-o, oh-o-o, oh-oo

I'm a reckless mistake
I'm a cold night's intake
I'm a one night too long
I'm a come on too strong
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane
Can't slow down, I'm a rollin' freight train
One more time, gotta start all over
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover
I'm a hold my cards close
I'm a wreck what I love most
I'm a first class letdown
I'm a "shut up, sit down"
I am a head case
I am the color of boom
That's never arriving
And you are the pay raise
Always a touch out of view
And I am the color of boom

I'm a reckless mistake

Hey, Mr. Cage Man

Cherry bomb, headstrong
I could fake my own death
Hey, Mr. Fate Man
Shuffle me a ninth life
I've been wrong, go long
Throwin' me a sharp right

It's not a picture-perfect life
Not what I had in mind
Let me write my own line

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus
I'm in this race, and
I'm hoping just to place
Oh, I'm trying not to face what's become of me
My hopeless opus

I'm gonna get ready
For the rain to pour heavy
Let it fall, fall
Let it fall upon my head

I've got this place
That I've filled with empty space
Oh, I'm trying not to face what I've done
My hopeless opus

"Man down, where you from, nigga "
"Fuck who you know! Where you from, my nigga "
"Where your grandma stay, huh, my nigga "
"This m.A.A.d city I run, my nigga"

Brace yourself, I'll take you on a trip down memory lane
This is not a rap on how I'm slingin' crack or move cocaine
This is cul-de-sac and plenty Cognac and major pain
Not the drill sergeant, but the stress that weighin' on your brain
It was me, L Boog, and Yan Yan
YG Lucky ride down Rosecrans
It got ugly, wavin' yo' hand out the window   check yourself!
Uh, Warriors and Conans
Hope euphoria can slow dance
With society, the driver seat the first one to get killed
Seen a light-skinned nigga with his brains blown out
At the same burger stand where *beep* hang out
Now this is not a tape recorder sayin' that he did it
But ever since that day, I was lookin' at him different
That was back when I was nine, Joey packed the nine
Pakistan on every porch is fine, we adapt to crime
Pack a van with four guns at a time
With the sliding door, fuck is up 
Fuck you shootin' for if you ain't walkin' up, you fuckin' punk 
Pickin' up the fuckin' pump, pickin' off you suckers
Suck a dick or die or sucker punch
A wall of bullets comin' from
AK's, AR's, "Ayy, y'all, duck!"
That's what Momma said when we was eatin' the free lunch
Aw man, goddamn, all hell broke loose
You killed my cousin back in '94, fuck yo' truce!
Now crawl your head in that noose
You wind up dead on the news
Ain't no peace treaty, just pieces BG's up to pre-approve
Bodies on top of bodies, IV's on top of IV's
Obviously the coroner between the sheets like the Isleys
When you hop on that trolley, make sure your colors correct
Make sure you're corporate or they'll be callin' your mother collect
They say the governor collect all of our taxes, except
When we in traffic and tragic happens, that shit ain't no threat
You movin' backwards if you suggest that you sleep with a TEC
Go buy a chopper and have a doctor on speed dial, I guess
Lets get It!

I said a hip hop the hippie the hippie
To the hip hip hop and you don't stop
The rock it to the bang bang boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the rhythm of the boogie, the beat


Now, what you hear is not a test, I'm rapping to the beat
And me, the groove, and my friends are gonna try to move your feet
You see I am Wonder Mike and I'd like to say "hello"
To the black, to the white, the red and the brown, the purple and yellow
But first, I gotta bang bang the boogie to the boogie
Say up jump the boogie to the bang bang boogie
Let's rock, you don't stop
Rock the rhythm that'll make your body rock
Well so far you've heard my voice, but I brought two friends along
And next on the mic is my man Hank; come on, Hank, sing that song:


Check it out, Well, I'm Imp the Dimp the ladies pimp
The women fight for my delight
But I'm the grandmaster with the three emcees
That shock the house for the young ladies
And when you come inside, into the front
You do the freak, spank, and do the bump
And when the sucker emcees try to prove a point
We're treacherous trio, uh, with a serious joint
A from sun to sun and from day to day
I sit down and write a brand new rhyme
Because they say that miracles never cease
I've created a devastating masterpiece
I'm gonna rock the mic til you can't resist
Everybody, I say it goes like this
Well I was coming home late one dark afternoon
Reporter stopped me for a interview
She said she's heard stories and she's heard fables
That I'm vicious on the mic and the turntables
This young reporter I did adore
So I rocked a vicious rhyme like I never did before
She said "damn fly guy I'm in love with you"
The Casanova legend must have been true
I said by the way baby what's your name
Said "I go by the name of Lois Lane"
And you could be my boyfriend you surely can
Just let me quit my boyfriend called Superman
I said he's a fairy I do suppose
Flying through the air in pantyhose
He may be very sexy or even cute
But he looks like a sucker in a blue and red suit
I said you need a man who's got finesse
And his whole name across his chest
He may be able to fly all through the night
But can he rock a party 'til the early light
He can't satisfy you with his little worm
But I can bust you out with my super sperm
I go do it, I go do it, I go do it, do it, do it
An I'm here and I'm there I'm Big Bank Hank, I'm everywhere
Just throw your hands up in the air
And party hardy like you just don't care
Let's do it, uh, don't stop y'all, uh, tick a tock y'all you don't stop

With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away 
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away


Off in the distance, there is resistance
Bubbling up and festering
Hey Mr. Motion, make me a potion
Shake it all up with your mystery
How come I've never seen your face around here 
I know every single face around here
A man on a mission, changing the vision
I was never welcome here


We don't have a choice to stay
We'd rather die than do it your way


With our backs to the wall, the darkness will fall
We never quite thought we could lose it all
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire
An empire's fall in just one day
You close your eyes and the glory fades
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away 
Ready, aim, fire, ready, aim, fire away

She says that the world is a broken mess
And it's always on her mind
She cries at the news when the shots ring out
Oh, every single time


And no, I cannot fix it, no, I cannot make it stop


So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "

She prays on her knees as the towers fall
To a god she does not know
She's begging him to stop the mess
As the Boston bombs will blow 
She says, "How could I ever believe in something
That would step aside and watch "
And I got no words to say 'cause I think I lost my faith
But I fake it for the day, oh, everything will be okay


But no, I cannot fix it, and I cannot make it stop


So I said, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "


I wish I had the answers
Something you could hold to
Only thing that's real to me is you


"Turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "
Oh, "Hey, turn your phone off, won't you look me in my eye 
Can't we live that real life, real life "



There's a red house over yonder
That's where my baby stays, oh
Lord, there's a red house over yonder
Lord, that's where my baby stays
I ain't been home to see my baby, oh
In ninety nine and one half days


Wait a minute, something's wrong here
This key won't unlock the door, oh
Wait a minute, something's wrong here
This key won't unlock the door
And I got a bad, bad feeling, oh
That my baby don't live here no more


Well I might as well go on over yonder, yeah
Back up on the hill

Lord, I might as well go back over yonder
Way back yonder 'cross the hill
'Cause if my baby don't love me no more, oh
I know her sister will!
Take us home, Wayne!




Oh
Oh
Oh, you love me so good
C'mon, one more time
Get it
Oh
Twenty miles from anyone
Set my sights on the setting sun
Heaven talks, but not to me
Cause Heaven knows that nothing good comes free


Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me 
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me 

I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down


Petty lies to everyone
In the hopes that I could be someone
Heaven talks, but not to me
And now I wonder if it's meant to be

 + 
Desolation tragedy
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me 
Is there nothing good in me, is there nothing good in me 
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down
I've let me down, down, down, down


I'll take your word, cause after all
You've never lied, oh not at all
But look at me, oh what a mess
I get caught up in the things that matter the least
Oh let me have release

You say you want a revolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
You tell me that it's evolution
Well, you know
We all want to change the world
But when you talk about destruction
Don't you know that you can count me out


Don't you know it's gonna be alright 
Don't you know it's gonna be alright 
Don't you know it's gonna be alright 


You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You'd better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of Chairman Mao
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be alright 
Don't you know it's gonna be alright 
Don't you know it's gonna be alright 

I was hopin' for an indication
I was seekin' higher elevation
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I've been shaken, wakin' in the night light
I've been breakin', hidin' from the spotlight
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye


The more I stray, the less I fear
And the more I reach, the more I fade away
The darkness right in front of me
Oh, it's calling out, and I won't walk away


I would always open up the door
Always lookin' up for higher floors
Wanna see it all give me more 
I was always up for makin' changes
Walkin' down the street meetin' strangers
Flippin' through my life turnin' pages 


Like a prayer that only needs a reason
Like a hunter waiting for the season
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye
I was there, but I was always leaving
I've been livin', but I was never breathing
Aye aye aye, aye aye aye

We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart


Where do we go from here 
Where do we go from here 
I threw some rocks up at your window, oh
I threw some rocks right through your window, ooh-ooh
Hey

Timber, timber, we're falling down
Let the forest hear our sound
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Boom, ba-doom ba-doom, ah-ooh ah-ooh
Why can't I see what's right in front of me 
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
We fall, we fall apart
Put your hands together everyone
I'd clap if I didn't have a broken hand, haha
Oh, it's early morning, the sun comes out
Last night was shaking and pretty loud
My cat is purring, it scratches my skin
So what is wrong with another sin 
Now the bitch is hungry, she needs to tell
So give her inches and feed her well
More days to come, new places to go
I've got to leave, it's time for a show


Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Here I am
Rock you like a hurricane
Oh, here I am
Rock you like a hurricane


My body is burning, it starts to shout
Desire is coming, it breakin' me out
Lust is in cages 'til storm breaks loose
Just have to make it with someone I choose
The night is calling, I have to go
The wolf is hungry, he runs the show
He's licking his lips, he's ready to win
On the hunt tonight for Love at First Sting

Sweeping the floors, open up the doors, yeah
Turn on the lights, getting ready for tonight
Nobody's romancing 'cause it's too early for dancing
But here comes the music


Bright lights flashing to cover up your lack of
So many people, so many problems, so many reasons
To buy another round, drink it down
Just another night on the town
With the big man, money man, better than the other man
He got the plan with the million dollar give a damn
When nobody understands, he'll become a smaller man
The bright lights keep flashing, the women keep on dancing

With the clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down
Yeah, yeah
The Rodeo Clowns
Yeah, yeah, yeah
They pick me up when I'm down


The disco ball spinning, all the music and the women and
The shots of Tequila, man they'll say that they need ya
But what they really need, is just a little room to breath
Teeny bopping disco queen, she barely understands
Her dreams of bellybutton rings and other kinds of things


Symbolic of change but the thing that is strange
Is that the changes occurred, and now she's just a part of the herd
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Man I thought that you heard
Yeah, yeah
The changes occurred
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Just a part of the herd

So if you're tired of the
Same old story
C'mon c'mon c'mon
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Yeah, whoo


As soon as you are able
Woman I am willing
To make the break that we
Are on the brink of
My cup is on the table
Our love is spilling
Waiting here for you to
Take and drink of


So if you're tired of the
Same old story
Oh, turn some pages
I'll be here when you are ready
To roll with the changes
Oh yeah
C'mon baby

Don't throw stones at me
Don't tell anybody

Trouble finds me 
All the noise of this
Has made me lose my belief


I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Another day, another door
Another high, another low
Rock bottom, rock bottom, rock bottom
I'm going back to my roots
Had to lose my way
To know which road to take

Trouble found me 
All I look for was
Washed away by a wave


We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling 
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling 


You don t have to hold your head up high


Round and round
I won t run away this time
'Til you show me what this life is for
Round and round
I m not gonna let you change my mind
'Til you show me what this life is for


We are afflicted by fiction, by fiction
Building a case for eviction, eviction
Circling 
Guarding a tower of ancients, of ancients
Shooting down arrows of patience, impatiently
Circling 

We are all living the same way, the same way
We are escaping the same way, the same way
Circling 
We are a part of the same play, the same play
We think we're making our own way, our own way
Circling 


But you don t have to hold your head up high

'Round and 'round

Around and 'round
I m not gonna let you change my mind

One look, twice sold, three, four oh the way she looks at me
Held up, let down, she sings me silent melodies
Hair whipped, tight lipped, I've been calling out for you
Cold sweat, once met, can't stand the way she looks at me


Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, just all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway
Do the rumble and sway


One look, twice bold, three, four, I'm on my knees for her
Held up, let down, she sings me perfect harmonies
She fakes heart breaks, I'd take just a part of you
Those eyes, sweet lies, I've been drowning out for you


Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't leave your money at home, just a word to the wise
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies


Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, just all of your lies
Don't you tell me no truths, I want all of your lies
I'm wailing, so give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies
Give me all of your lies

Older than water, stubborn as stone
There'll be no forgiveness for all that you've known
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy
Hotter than friction, subtle as sound
There'll be no forgiveness for you to come around
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy


I get older and life fades
But you remain
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Quicker than lightning, whiter than bone
If you can erase it, then I can atone
Oh these days, oh these days get heavy

 + 
I get older and life fades
But you remain
Open up again, I believe in second chances
Please let me in, oh I believe in second chances
I won't break you, I will not let you down
Open up again, I believe in second chances

To the top of all the world
To the tasteless underworld
To the center of your heart
Oh, Cleopatra is the only one you loved
To the demonstrated smile
To the lonely love child
Destination desolation
Tell me when you reach the brink of life
Just a picture on your wall
That's nice, what a metaphoric fall


Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve
Oh, what an indication
To the center of the pain
Through the tattered window pane
To the middle of your heart


Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene
This is not what I expect
This is not what I expect
I can see it in your tears
And now they re crowning me the Caesar

Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
Doo-doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo


I'm packed and I'm holding, I'm smiling
She's living, she's golden, she lives for me
Says she lives for me
Ovation, her own motivation
She comes 'round and she goes down on me
And I make her smile like a drug for you
Do ever what you want to do, coming over you
Keep on smiling what we go through
One stop to the rhythm that divides you


And I speak to you like the chorus to the verse
Chop another line like a coda with a curse
Come on like a freak show, takes the stage
We give them the games we play, she said


I want something else
To get me through this
Semi-charmed kind of life, baby, baby
I want something else
I'm not listening when you say
Goodbye

Trouble
Blood is in the rocky waters
Hide away your sons and daughters
Eat you alive
Levels
Better put your head on swivels
Dancin' with the very devil
Butter to knife

You think you're better than them
Better than them
You think they're really your friends
Really your friends
But when it comes to the end
To the end
You're just the same as them
Same as them 


So l t it go, let it go
That's the way that it goes
First you'r  in, then you're out
Everybody knows
You're hot, then you're cold
You're a light in the dark
Just you wait and you'll see
That you're swimmin' with sharks


He's comin' to get you
 Woop, woop
He's comin' to get you, get
 Woop

I want a girl with the right allocations
Who is fast and thorough and sharp as a tack
She is playing with her jewelry, she is putting up her hair
She is touring the facility and picking up slack


I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket


I want a girl who gets up early 
I want a girl who stays up late 
I want a girl with uninterrupted prosperity
Who uses a machete to cut through red tape
With fingernails that shine like justice
And a voice that is dark like tinted glass
She is fast, thorough, and sharp as a tack
She is touring the facility and picking up slack

I want a girl with a short skirt and a long, long jacket


Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na


I want a girl with a smooth liquidation 
I want a girl with good dividends 
At Citibank we will meet accidentally
We'll start to talk when she borrows my pen
She wants a car with a cup holder armrest
She wants a car that will get her there
She is changing her name from Kitty to Karen
She is trading her MG for a white Chrysler Le Baron


I want a girl with a short skirt and a long jacket


Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na-na-na

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
Am I out of touch  Am I out of my place
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space 
Oh, I'm wishin' you're here
But I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong


Oh, I'm gonna mess this up
Oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again
I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, it seems I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
Am I out of luck  Am I waiting to break 
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh, I'm wishin' I had
What I'd taken for granted
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong

Am I out of touch  Am I out of my place

In the meantime, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
At the bay side, we used to show
In the moonlight, we let it go
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me 
Oh let it drift away

And then I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through everything I loved
Oh, I shot, shot, shot a hole
Through every single thing that I loved
I loved, I loved, I loved
Every single thing that I loved
I loved, I loved, I loved
Every single thing that I loved
I loved, I loved, I loved...
Am I out of touch  Am I out of my place 
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for an empty space
Oh I'm wishin' you're here, but I'm wishin' you're gone
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again


In the mean time, we let it go
At the road sign we used to know
We can let this drift away
Oh we let this drift away
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
And there's always time to change your mind
Oh love, can you hear me 

I'm sorry for everything, oh, everything I've done
From the second that I was born, I think I had a loaded gun
And then I shot, shot, shot a hole through everything I loved
Oh I shot, shot, shot a hole through every single thing that I loved


Am I out of luck  Am I waiting to break 
When I keep sayin' that I'm lookin' for a way to escape
Oh I'm wishin' I had what I'm takin' for granted
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
Oh, I'm gonna mess this up, oh, this is just my luck
Over and over and over again

Fall right down to the bottom
Boy with a motto
Stay, but I oughta leave, and trust me, my heart bleeds
I feel everything, I
Drip, drop, drink out of the bottle
Boy with a heart of gold, get run over by heaven knows what
Weary soldier, I get older, life gets colder


Sometimes I get a little bit scared at night
I get a little preoccupied
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
I just wanna be good again
I wanna make it to the end
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind


Autumn, stuck in th  grotto
Been tryin' for the lottery but nev r win
My heart bleeds, I feel everything, I
Drop, drop, way down to the bottom
Boy with a heart of gold, get run over by heaven knows what
Weary soldier, I get older, life gets colder


Sometimes I get a little bit scared at night
I get a little preoccupied
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind
I just wanna be good again
I wanna make it to the end
The sirens in my mind, the sirens in my mind

I wake up every morning with a new resolve
Two hands and one heart, let the world revolve
One eye to the ocean and one to the sky
One life of devotion and where am I 
One heart to love within my chest
One life to live


I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones

One chance to reach out and find a place for me
One chance to find love for all humanity
One eye to the mountain and one to the sands
One dime for the fountain and one for my hand
One heart to love within my chest
One heart to love


I keep skipping stones, hoping for a change
But things just stay the same
I keep walking roads, looking for a home
That I can call my own
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
Skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones
I'm skipping stones


Love is not a product of reasonings and statistics. It just comes   none knows whence   and cannot explain itself
Love is a madness, if thwarted it develops fast
When you fish for love, bait with your heart, not your brain

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and pretend
She s sober, bored, and self-assured
Oh no, I know a dirty word


Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello


With the lights out, it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito, my libido, yeah




I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, and I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always have until the end

This is my word, this is my way
Show me a sign, sweep me away
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
Deep in my heart, deep in my mind
Take me away, take me away
This is my word, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind


All I believe, is it a dream
That comes crashing down on me 
All that I hope
Is it just smoke and mirrors 
I want to believe, whoa
But all that I know
Is it just smoke and mirrors  
All that I've known, buildings of stone
Fall to the ground without a sound
This is my word, heartbreaker, gatekeeper
I'm feeling far away, I'm feeling right there
I'm starting to cave, I'm losing my flame
I wanted your truth, but I wanted the pain
To disappear, dream maker, life taker
Open up my mind

If I were you, I'd run away
Closin' your eyes and count to ten
Bird in the sky, peace in your mind
Closin' the door on yesterday
So many voices
So many voices


If I was me, weight on my back
Feelin' the sun upon my eyes
Where would I turn  What would I burn 
I am a pawn within your hands
So many voices
So many voices

Leavin' my youth, leavin' my truth
Carvin' in my blood into the stone
Lesser of two, either you lose
Or you come out and be alone
So many voices
There's so many choices
So many voices


What do I do  Where do I turn 
Even my screams cease to be heard
Lesser of two
Either you lose
Or you are bound to be alone
So many choices
There's so many noises
So many voices
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!
Woohoo!


I got my head checked
By a jumbo jet
It wasn't easy
But nothing is, c'mon!


 When I hear heavy metal
 And I'm pins and I'm needles
 When, I'm comin' up easy
All of the time when I get that way, it ain't easy
But nothin' else is!
Woohoo!


I got my head done
When I was young
It's not my problem
It's not my problem
None
Draw a rumor; flashing lights and let all whispers die
Sixteen colors, I'm so lonely
Let, let the picture dry


'Cause everybody sees things differently
And everybody says things rationally
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go
So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go

Suppressed emotions flying past
Are heading out the other end
The precious love, the daily grind
It's wonderful
Elastic wasted, rubber ghost
Are floating past the midnight hour
They push aside the things that matter most
Wonderful
Trace the faces, X the places where the judges lie
I'm not scared of all the nothings
Let, let the whispers die


'Cause everybody sees things differently

And everybody says things rationally

So open up your heart, open up your mind
Speak, speak, speak, speak to me

Speak, speak, speak, speak to me
Let it go


I-M-A-G-I-N-E, oh

When the night has come
And the land is dark
And the moon is the only light we see
No I won't be afraid, no I won't, I won't be afraid
Just as long as you stand, stand by me


So darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand, stand by me, stand by me

If the sky that we look upon 
Should tumble and fall
The mountain should crumble to the sea
I won't cry, I won't cry, no, I won't shed a tear
Just as long as you stand, stand by me


And darlin', darlin', stand by me, oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me




And darlin', darlin', stand by me, stand by me
Oh, stand by me, oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me


Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me
Oh, stand by me
Oh, stand now, stand by me, stand by me
Do you realize it's almost come 
Do you realize it's almost come 
Walkin' for a while until its done
Beatin' on my back and tell it to run
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open


Lay me down
Lay me down

'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
The old and the young
Save me from myself
Starlight


Do you realize it's almost here 
Do you realize it's almost here 
Walkin' for a while into this year
Beatin' on my back until it's here
I'm gonna make it into much
I'm gonna breathe until I burst open, open


Lay me down
Lay me down


'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight
'Cause you were right, and I'm wrong
Could this be over for too long
Save me from myself
Starlight

Lost at sea, so unexplored, tomorrow the world goes dark
Bring you home, tell me why
She lives to hear me talk about
Where the dreams, they cry
And hit, oh, high my face for more
The  move just wanna know
She's all I want so 


Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you

Set me free from all the fields of all the squinted eyes
Tell me why the sun, it died
Tell me all the lies you hear
About a time when I was young
And all I hear was trying to find


Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for you


Kiss me when the sun is gone
Hold me in your arms
Tell me why this darkness is a lie upon the stars


Too late, I was waiting on a broken day
I wish the world would sit and wait
For you, for you
For you, for youNone
Clenched teeth, no words
All this distance taking its toll
Speaking volumes
Silence screaming over your words


I never did you right, I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again

Can we start over 
Can we start over 
Can we start over
Before it's over, over 


Cold nights, cold sheets
One more lonely empty hotel room
What I'd give to
Find my way back into you


I never did you right, and I know that
Too many sleepless nights, I own that
I said it time and time, I know that
I wanna try again


Can we start over 
Can we start over 
Can we start over
Before it's over, over 
Can we start over 
Can we get closer 
Can we start over
Before it's over, over 
None
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again
They ve always been so kind
But now they ve brought you away from me
I hope they didn't get your mind
Your heart is too strong anyway
We need to fetch back the time
That they have stolen from us


'Cause I want you
We can bring it on the floor
We've never danced like this before
We don t talk about it
Dancing on, do the boogie all night long
Stoned in paradise
Shouldn t talk about it, shouldn't talk about it


The coldest winter for me
No sun is shining anymore
The only thing I feel is pain
It's caused by absence of you
Suspense is controllin' my mind
I cannot find the way outta here
I want you by my side
So that I never feel alone again

Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you, ooh, you, ooh


I've been afraid, don't wanna fade out of my body
I've been astray, barely awake, floating above me
Covered in gray, what can I say  I've been a zombie
I'm feeling like I've been locked in a grave
You were the laugh, you were the life, you were the party
You were the brave, I was the weak, you were the army
You were the faith, you were the truth, I was the sorry
I'm feeling like you've been taken away


You were my one, you were my one
When all has been said, all has been done
You were my one, you were my one
Now I am left reaching above me, oh, oh


Time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh 
Yeah, time goes by and still I am stuck on you
Ooh, you, ooh 

I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty; that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety 
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us 
Feeling the world go against us 
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain

If only for a second
Let me have you
Tell me all your secrets
Let me know you


Paint me all your pictures
Hang them on my wall
Show me all your colors
Show me all



Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be


A fire burns into you
Purifying all
And what I saw was opulence
And that's not for me
 And that's not for me
 And that's not for me
Only in the summertime 
Only in the summertime 
Things will change with time 
Only in the summertime


Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be
Open up your eyes, open up your mind
Fall in line with what you're meant to be


Only in the summertime 
Only in the summertime 
Things will change with time 
Only in the summertime
Ever since I was young 
Always marching to a drum 
Always focused on me 
Now I wish that I could hold someone 


So tell my mom, I love her
Call my baby sister
Should've hugged and kissed her
'Cause life is just a mystery
And it's gone before you know it
So if you love me, won't you show it 

'Cause this life is one big symphony
This night is one for you and me
I'm the strings and you're the timpani
You're my constant tambourine
This life is one big symphony
So glad I've got you next to m 
I'm the chords and you're the m lody
This life's one big symphony


She was the piano
I'm the xylophone
You can have the trumpet
I'm the saxophone


Life is skipping rope 
Finding solace in a note 
Had to struggle when I was broke 
Writing music just to cope 


Yeah, life is just perspective
Laughing when you've wrecked it
Smiling when you kept it together
You weathered the storm
At the end of the play, you sang all the way
Doesn't matter how off-key if you did it your way

Last week, I came to you
I didn't know what to do
Yeah, man, sometimes I lie
But sometimes I can tell the truth
I want my money back
Life's one big heart attack
Yeah, man, my throat is dry
Someday everybody's gonna die


Take it easy on me
I need some lullabies
They tell me heaven's just a lie
Well, I'm not surprised
Tell me that you know
No, you don't
Yeah, you're just like me
Can't we just all hope for the best
Take it  asy


Money don't grow on trees
I'm such a greedy thief
Spend my lif , I'm huntin'
Keep drinkin' just to find relief
My auntie's pretty cool
She did real well in school
But she still don't know
Where we really go

So if you're lonely, you know I'm here waiting for you
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot away from you
And if you leave here, you leave me broken, shattered, I lie
I'm just a crosshair, I'm just a shot, then we can die


I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, "Don't you know " You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
I say, "Don't you know " You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
Well, I say, "Don't you know " You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"


I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here
I know I won't be leaving here with you


I say, "Don't you know " You say, "You don't know"
I say, "Take me out"
If I move, this could die
Eyes move, this can die
Come on now, take me out

You give me love
But then you take it away
And I'm left to search where to hide
You give me love , love 
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times


I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love , love 
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh

Take, take, take
But don't give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall


You give me headaches
Oh, all I need is a break
From your clever little lies
You give me love , love 
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times


I think I'm cursed
I think I'm dying for days
As I build to the top with you
You give me love , love 
All of your eyes that have cursed me countless times, oh


Take, take, take
But don t give it back now
Wait, wait, wait
I've loaded up a gun
Bang, bang, bang
I bang on your back door
Hang, hang, hang
Me up on your wall
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh

Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh
Oooh-oooh

Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh
Ooh-oooh

Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-ooh
Woah-woah-woah
Woah-woah-woahNone


Maybe I'm broken, maybe I'm wrong
I could've spoken sooner than I should've
Only the good die old
That's what they told me, but I don't know


Maybe I'm breaking up with myself
Maybe I'm thinking
I should just keep to the things that I've been told
Wait for the colors to turn to gold
Do you know  Do you know 
You're all I know, you're all I know
When everything comes crashing down
You're all I know, you're all I know


I'm ready for the fall
I'm ready for everything that I believed in to drift away
Ready for the leaves
Ready for the colors to burn to gold and crumble away

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes


Sitting here all by ourselves, counting all the people
As they pass us by
They gather all around and stare on down into a dark, dark pit
Don't go, please don't go
But they step on in, oh, they fall all in, they walk all over you
'Cause one step at a time, they all walk in a line
Down a false, false hope


I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes
I would rather stay here
Where the moon, it glows
Soaring doves and falling crows
Laughter is the only sound we'd hear


If I had one wish
I'd fill up that pit, I'd fill up that pit, oh
I'd cry 'til it filled to the brim
You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand

I would rather stay here
Where the flowers bloom and the sun, it shines
It shines on you
It lights up your eyes

You'd swim to the top
And I'd grab your hand


Oh, how can I, how can I convince you to stay 
Where all the flowers bloom, the grass, it sways
And the rain, it pours, and the waves all roar
And the trees they grow
And the fallen crow soars down into that dark cold pit
And you follow it in
Oh, you follow it in

In the latest midnight hour when the world has gone to sleep
You gotta get up
When doubts begin to rise and the world is at your feet
You gotta get up


Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself
But myself


I'm not a selfless man, I'm not a man of wealth
If I had all the world, probably give it to myself
But the trees begin to walk
And the ground begins to talk by myself


Reach
It's not as bad as it seems
I cleanse in the river for somebody else
For anyone but myself

Woman help me, you turn my head in circles
Mama blessed me with magnet eyes for purple
Oh so let me show you something good
Pastor, preacher, I wanna say I'm sorry
Nice to meet ya', I think my eyes are starry
Pledge allegiance to my only


Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me


Auntie Mara, I think you know my reasons
I was a product of everything in season
Oh so heavy, set me free again
Oh my papa, if all the world could know you
You could stop a thousand wars across the globe
Oh I miss ya', show them something good
Sooner or later it all comes around
Hopefully then I will see
After the people and places are gone
You will come back, you will come back to me
To me, to me
You will come back to me
To me, to me

I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
I'm that star up in the sky
I'm that mountain peak up high
Hey, I made it
I'm the world's greatest
And I'm that little bit of hope
When my back's against the ropes
I can feel it
I'm the world's greatest
Hum, dum-dum-dum, dum-dum
Hum-dum, dum, hum-dum, dum


He was never gonna make it
Every pill he found, he'd take it
Always on the edge of breakdowns
Keepin' it together somehow
Just another cold November
You called me, but I didn't answer
I was so oblivious, now, I'm askin' for forgiveness
For every single time I failed you
I'm feelin' like it's me that killed you
Rememberin' the time they jumped you
And I was too scared to help you
Looking back, I can't erase it
I guess it's time to face it
You never seemed to know how to let it all go

Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do


Everybody saw you smilin'
That you were always good at hiding
You were always asking questions, so you wouldn't draw attention
Everyone who used you, they never really knew you
You're always showin' up for everybody but yourself 
See, I wish I could take it back
Change the future and erase the past
Grab the bullet out and pull you back
I promise that I'd save your life like you saved mine
But now, it's far too late for that
And all I have is your story left to tell
So, let me tell it, let me tell


Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do
Don't listen to a single word they say about you
They don't know you like I do

If only you, you could see
The darkest place that you could be
Oh, maybe then, you'd understand
From desert heat to cobbled streets
From broken home to the city beat
There's so much more than you could know


So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief


If I could live a thousand times
If I could make a thousand tries
Oh, maybe then, I'd get it right
The more I see, the more I know
That everyone just wants a show
No, we don't want to see the truth


So take me back when I believed
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief
And all the heights that I could reach
Back when I was unafraid, just like a thief

Rise up this mornin'
Smiled at the risin' sun
Three little birds
Sittin' on my doorstep
They're singin' sweet songs
Of melodies pure and true
Singing, "this is my message to you"


Singing don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright
I'm singing don't worry 'bout a thing
Now don't worry 'bout a thing
'Cause every little thing gonna be alright

Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my own life behind
Not a "Yes, sir," not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder

Who do you think you are 
Dreaming 'bout being a big star
They say, "You're basic," they say, "You're easy"
You're always riding in the backseat

They say you're basic, they say you're easy

Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds

So you're still thinking of me, just like I know you should
I cannot give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment, I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give


While we're young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids


Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things

Not a yessir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number

All this time I've spent with you
All that we've been through
Still we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you
I am tied to you


You call me up just to say
You think we're better off this way
Leaves may fall, seasons change
Yet we remain
A year away, a year alone
The tears have fall, but we have grown
The sun will rise, the seasons change 
And here we are


All this time I've spent with you

All that we've been through
And we're holding on
All this time I've spent with you

Still I am tied to you

I'm feeling rough, I m feeling raw
I'm in the prime of my life
Let's make some music, make some money
Find some models for wives
I ll move to Paris, shoot some heroin
And fuck with the stars
You man the island and the cocaine
And the elegant cars


This is our decision, to live fast and die young
We've got the vision, now let's have some fun
Put down and that will be the end
We're fated to pretend

I'll miss the playgrounds
And the animals and digging up worms
I'll miss the comfort of my mother
And the weight of the world
I'll miss my father, miss my mother
Miss my dog and my home
Yeah, I'll miss the boredom and the freedom
And the time spent alone


But there is really nothing, nothing we can do
Love must be forgotten, life can always start anew
The models will have children, we ll get a divorce
We ll have some more models, everything must run its course
We'll choke on our vomit and that will be the end
We re fated to pretend


Yeah yeah yeah
Yeah yeah yeah


In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them 
They never seem to catch my eye
But I've never wondered why


I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...

Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher


From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them 
They never look to see me fly
So I've never had to lie


I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep...


Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher


Nobody else
Nobody else
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else can take me higher
Nobody else...

In the morning light, let my roots take flight
Watch me fall above like a vicious dove
They don't see me come, who can blame them 
Never stopped to see me try
I've never had to lie


I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep


Hey, yeah, don't let 'em know we're coming
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher
Take some time to simmer down, keep your head down low
Hey, yeah, tiptoe higher


From your slanted view, see the morning dew
Sink into the soil, watch the water boil
They won't see me run, who can blame them 
Never stopped to see me try
I've never had to lie


I won't fall asleep
I won't fall asleep

Got dressed in the morning light
Gotta leave this place far behind
Breathe or die
You say I don't wanna go back
I don't wanna go back
Take me home tonight
Breathe or die


We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And we could try so hard
To fall down, to fall down


Make my way where the sirens sleep
You can take my life but spare my soul
Breathe or die
They say you don't really care, you don't really care
Give me a reason to die
Breathe or die


We could run so far
To fall down, to fall down
And could we try so hard
To fall down, to fall down

Baby's got a lot of baggage
It don't seem to matter, it don't seem to matter
Bought a ticket to the mid-west, just for business
But dismissed it from the interest
It was a risk just for a mistress
Who was a hostess on the West Coast
Don't you see it in my eyes tonight 
Baby's got a lot of baggage


Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul 
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll

Get that dynamite
Chick-a-boom on the town tonight
I never seem to get it right
But you can show me so politely
Now don't you see it in my eyes tonight 
Get that dynamite


Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul 
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll


Hey, I come back to where you are
Hey, I come back to where you are
Get that dynamite


Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul 
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll
Where do I have to go
To find a honey with a little soul 
Tokyo, Tokyo, turn out the lights and let it go
Oh, it's nice to meet you
Kimi tanoshimu
Tokyo, Tokyo, pay in the palms of the rock'n'roll

A modern-day warrior
Mean, mean stride
Today's Tom Sawyer
Mean, mean pride


Though his mind is not for rent
Don't put him down as arrogant
His reserve a quiet defense
Riding out the day's events
The river

What you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the mist
Catch the myth
Catch the mystery
Catch the drift


The world is, the world is
Love and life are deep
Maybe as his skies are wide
Today's Tom Sawyer, he gets high on you
And the space he invades, he gets by on you




No, his mind is not for rent
To any god or government
Always hopeful, yet discontent
He knows changes aren't permanent
But change is


And what you say about his company
Is what you say about society
Catch the witness
Catch the wit
Catch the spirit
Catch the spit

Baby, can't you see I'm calling 
A guy like you should wear a warning
It's dangerous, I'm falling
There's no escape, I can't wait
I need a hit, baby, give me it
You're dangerous, I'm loving it


Too high, can't come down
Losing my head, spinnin' 'round and 'round
Do you feel me now 


With a taste of your lips, I'm on a ride
You're toxic, I'm slippin' under
With a taste of a poison paradise
I'm addicted to you
Don't you know that you're toxic 
And I love what you do
Don't you know that you're toxic 


It's getting late to give you up
I took a sip from my devil's cup
Slowly, it's taking over me

Oh, quiet down, I've had enough
I guess it's now or never
I've been around, I've settled up
I'll bolt soon or later
I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me

So pray for me, brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me, sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble


Oh pack it up, and hit the road
And only take my lighter
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam
But I prefer the pay dirt
I took a photograph of me
When I was only nineteen
I looked a little lost at sea
I keep trying to find me


So pray for me brother, I need redemption
I'm just a man, a man on a mission
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
Pray for me sister, give me a mention
I got no faith, and oh, did I mention
I want no trouble, I want no trouble
I want no trouble, I want no trouble

Early morning, take me over

They say that time will tell
But I got this broken shell

They  all
I've got 
You 
Broken homes, fighting brothers
Drugs sold upon the streets
Terrorism and alcoholism
These selfish motives guide the world
Weeping mothers, whoa, crying fathers
What has this world come to 


They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing 
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it 
They are so broken but, oh, we hear them singing, oh-oh-oh
Whoa-oh-oh, whoa-oh-oh
Can you believe it, it's what we're seeing
It's just a dream, dream, can you believe-lieve it 


Let me be your brother, you can be my sister
We're singing to the people
Let's live until we die


Grew up for business
I'll do whatever it takes
Don't work a day unless you're paid
One night stands and broken hearts
We forgot how to love
I'll shoot 'em up and take 'em down
Oh, don't bleed on my ground
 Wanna stick it like a butta peanut butter peanut."

You're a bad omen-
Say goodbye to all your friends
They will miss you when this trends
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight


Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it
When the current drags me in 
Leave me to the hands of men 
I get so uptight, I get so uptight
I get so uptight, I get so uptight


Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it
Sit tight, green light, everybody's out at night, go
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it
Those things they believe in, they get hazy
I think I mean it
I am aching, near breaking
I'm just taking my time to stand in line
For a dance with you, whoa, dance with you, whoa oh
It may not appear, but it's been fully clear
That I'm standing here, fully pleading, near bleeding
Dying, for a chance with you, oh, whoa


Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
If I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I can stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you


If you stand with my heart in hand
Oh, perfect and, perfect and, perfect and
So unaware of my longing stare
If all I care is to dance with you


Passion tops, time stops, volume drops
You put your face to mine
I respond, holding you in kind
Baby, I could stay forever in time as I dance with you, you, you

Do you feel the same when I'm away from you  
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you  
We could turn around or we could give it up
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
Oh, the storm is ragin' against us now 
If you're afraid of falling, then don't look down 
But we took the step, oh, we took the leap
And we'll take what comes, take what comes

Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here


We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire
There's nights we had to just walk away 
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade 
It's a price you pay when it comes to love
And we'll take what comes, take what comes


Feel the wind in your hair
Feel the rush way up here


We're walkin' the wire, love
We're walkin' the wire, love
We couldn't be higher, up
We're walkin' the wire, wire, wire

As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust
The time will come, when you'll have to rise
Above the rest and prove yourself
Your spirit never dies
Farewell, I've gone to take my throne above
But don't weep for me, 'cause this will be
The labor of my love
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
Here we are, don't turn away now 
We are the warriors that built this town 
From dust

Twenty-one years, she figured it out
She started a job, she's feeling it out
And for once it feels right
Was feeling like the prime of her life
But all of that is just a dream
Shattered now and everything's changed
With one car and one night
Was driving through the prime of your life


Took your freedom
There's no reason, just keep breathing
Time doesn't hear if you ask it to wait


La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So own all your tears and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Life, it could change, it could change in a day
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
So cherish your years and just roll with the waves
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da-da
Time doesn't hear, so roll with the waves


Eleven years old, my only friend
You'd taken me in, but where was I 
When he took his life
Oh, I was singing in the prime of my life

One more day we'll spend together
Let your eyes look up upon me for the better
Oh, I know I'm worse for weather
But, my love, I won't give up
Spend my days cursing my soul
Wishing I could paint my scars and make me whole
Oh, I know I could be better
But, my love, I won't give up


I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one that keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most

Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, hey, hey, hey, oh
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be, I'll be your West Coast, honey
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh


I'll change my ways if you would stay
And all your tears that you have cried will go away
Oh, just grant me one more day
Oh, my love, please don't give up
See the Devil at my door
I see the future of the ones that I've ignored
I guess I was born to be at war
And, my love, I won't give up
So, my love, please don't give up


I ain't no Superman, I ain't no Holy Ghost
I'm just the one who keeps you up at night, you love the most
I'll be your strong man, I'll be your West Coast
I'll be the sun, I'll be the waves, I'll be the one you love the most
Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling, it's vulturous
Negative, nepotist

Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this

Whip, whip
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up

Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
Just like the ones I used to know
Where the treetops glisten and children listen
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
Ring-a-ding-a-dong, ding-dong-dong


I m dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white



Oh, I, I, I, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas
With every Christmas card I write
May your days, may your days, may your days be merry and bright
And may all your Christmases be white
Up in the morning
Up in the evening
Picking up clocks
When the birds come back to eat
Oh, to eat
Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
Pushing these blocks
In the heat of the afternoon
Oh, afternoon


We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
No


It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day
Oh, won't you save us
What we are 
Don't look clear
'Cause it's all uphill from here
Oh
None
See the stone set in your eyes
See the thorn twist in your side
And I wait for you
Sleight of hand and twist of fate
On a bed of nails she makes me wait
And I wait without you


With or without you
With or without you

Through the storm, we reach the shore
You give it all but I want more
And I'm waiting for you


With or without you
With or without you, oh-no
I can't live with or without you


And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away


My hands are tied
My body's bruised she's got me with
There's nothing to win
And there's nothing left to lose


And you give yourself away
And you give yourself away
And you give, and you give
And you give yourself away

Today is gonna be the day that they're gonna throw it back to you
By now, you should have somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now


Backbeat, the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now


And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how


'Cause maybe
You're gonna be the one that saves me
And after all
You're my wonderwall


Today was gonna be the day but they'll never throw it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you're not to do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do, about you now

Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake, it shake it, and we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
Shake it shake it, and we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it shake it, and we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
Shake it

Every little bit goes a little of a long way
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway
Home, ho-oh-oh-ome 
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes
No, no-oh-oh-oh 


So tell me, tell me, tell me
What am I to do 
I think that this life is darker than the view
So help me, help me, help me
Be a little more like you
When everything is falling
I'm gonna do the things you do


Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
Been a long time coming for the working man
Shake it, shake it, and we're moving again
When the money is high, we can start to spend
Shake it

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on 


These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost

Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day


Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck


They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on 


These days I'm becoming everything that I hate

Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday


All these years, I've been searching
For who I'm supposed to be
All this time I've been wasting
'Cause I was right in front of me
Oh, it's a crooked old tradition
By a masterful magician
But in all this trouble I've met
I haven't got one single regret, no
Here's to my future
Here's to my yesterday
Here's to change
Oh, here's to my yesterday
No tomorrow without a yesterday
Here's to my future
Goodbye to yesterday
Yesterday

You don't stop, you run
You  don't stop, you run
You  don't stop
You don't stop, you run
You don't stop, you run
You  don't stop
You  don't stop, you run
You don't stop, you run
You  don't stop
You don't stop, you run
You don't stop, you run
You don't stop

Oh,  oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh
Seems there's something in the air today
It s got me feeling, oh, a certain way
Seems like lately, I've been on the run
It's got me reeling every night I m done
Keep thinking, what am I supposed to do 
My body's not working like it used to
And these bills keep piling up on me
Remember when I had no responsibilities


So take me back when I was younger
And I was still hungry, oh
Take me back when I was younger
Yeah, I got the world at my feet
Just try and stop me 
Yeah, take me back when I was younger


Watching all my friends pass away
When they promised me that they would be here today
I wish that I could put a force field
Around every single one of us
I would protect you from everything
 All around us
And ground us forever and ever
None
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time


But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don t wanna do it just to do it for you


Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Hello, hello
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out
