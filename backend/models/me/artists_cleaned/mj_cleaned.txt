Memories of growing up
And working hard
Our childhood passed us by
Mom and Dad
They sacrificed their wants and need
So we could reach the light

Although the times were tough for us
We knew they both worked hard
They gave us all their hearts could give
And still made room for love


We're all united
And standing strong
And still today
We're one big family


2300 Jackson Street
Always home
2300 Jackson Street
Always home


In harmony, together we'll join
Hands and sing
Our love across the land
Mmm


Remember we always said
If we got a chance
We'll plan our work
And work our master plan

The best time of day for me is at recess
That's when you talked to me
I think I'm the boy you like the best
I want more than a friend to be

He wanna be your fella just trying to tell ya but you pay him no mind
He's no price charmer still he keeps trying girl you're so unkind
I can love you really really love you, I can tell at just a glance
I can please you really really please you girl give me half a chance

You need a man that satisfies
Someone that cares for you
Someone to hold all through the night
Make your dreams come true
You need a man to treat you right
Who knows just what to do
Heart to heart or else you'll pass him by
Break his heart it two
Don't you know

Pretty baby
You drive me crazy
Fallin' for your love
Life is so good when I'm with you
Just bein' friends is not enough
Say, could one day, maybe
You be my lady
Together we'd be one
I thought you would realize
That I'm savin' all my love, ooh oh


24/7
I'll be right here waitin' for you
Can't get you off my mind

Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you

Thinkin' 'bout lovin' you
Kissin' and huggin' you
Can't get you off of my mind

Twenty-five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I've been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights
You know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin' for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin'
Make a boy go stone wild


I got to keep on walkin'
Oh I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all
I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride


I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin' my name
It's as if, as though
I'm standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips
I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine

I wake up my girl, get me mad right
The king of rock come on and there is none higher
Sucker MC's should call me sire
Standin' out here
Talking, broking, never joking, smoking
Up on the corner
Do what they wanna
Get outta here
Hasta la vista
Told me that you're doing wrong
Word out shocking all along
Cryin' wolf ain't like a man
Throwing rocks to hide your hands
You ain't done enough for me
You ain't done nuthin for me
You are disgusting me
You aiming just for me
You are disgusting me
Just want your cut from me
But too bad, too bad


Look who just walked in the place
Dead and stuffy in the face
Look who's standing, if you please
Try to bring me to my knees

No mercy!
This is officially a Refugee Camp Remix

Chorus: Michael Jackson
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say

Verse 2; Shafogrin
Made some promises that I couldn't get along with
You think I wasted your time Sita I'm sorry
I was rushing many things you won't hurry
But I promise everything that I felt is real
I kept fuckin' up the ties took you feelings for a joke
Girl you made me feel alright while you standing on a toe
Broke some promise and i lied many times you gotta know
I was something else a man "for the money not the ho"
And i wasted all our time while you kept on growing up
Nigga never had the time but you kept on holding up
Baby it took me a while now me growing up
A girl sleeping on a mat and me folding up

When dreamers dream and kiss their lover
And rainbows weave and splash their color
Those are moments so gloriously alive
We take the plunge, take the dive
Into the abyss
We are suspended awhile
Those are moments when babies smile

Those are moments when fate is unsealed
Nothing is impossible and we are h aled
We can soar, we can fly
Walk on fir , navigate the sky
In the light of a glittering star
There's no distance, nothing is far
Those are moments of innocent guile
In the glow
We are suspended awhile
Those are moments when babies smile

Those are moments when the heart is tender
When seascapes gleam in magnificent splendor
When the laughter of Heaven reverberates the Earth
And we are renewed in a new birth
In a timeless Eternity
In the angels' fraternity
We romp and roll
The playground of our soul
In the twilight
We are suspended awhile
Those are moments when babies smile

Everybody look around
'Cause there's a reason to rejoice, you see



]
Everybody look up
And feel the hope that we've been waiting on


]
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully




Can't you feel a brand new day 
Can't you feel a brand new day 
Can't you feel a brand new day 
Can't you feel a brand new day 


Everybody be glad
Because the sun is shining just for us
Everybody wake up
Into the morning, into happiness

, Diana Ross]
Hello world!
It's like a different way of living, now

We always knew that we'd be free somehow


In harmony
Let's show the world that we've got liberty
It's such a change
For us to live so independently
Freedom, you see
Has got our hearts singing so joyfully
Just look about
You owe it to yourself to check it out
Yeah, yeah
Ayo, Donald, it's time
It's time, Donald 
Straight out the pointless dungeons of rap

The mouse drops deep as does my aardvark
I never eat, 'cause to eat is the nephew of shark
Beyond the walls of flamingos, life is defined
I think of hammers when I'm in a Canada state of mind

Hope the park got some stark
My mark don't like no dirty dark
Run up to the shark and get the arc

In a Canada state of mind
What more could you ask for  The chewy mouse 
You complain about the heat
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the powerhouse

I'm rappin' to the head
And I'm gonna move your lead

Yummy, married, crazy, like a rod
Boy, I tell you, I thought you were a broad

I can't take the the heat, can't take the banana
I woulda tried to run I guess I got no piano

My first brick did it
I knew I was addicted when I flipped it to four
Then I whipped it to more
And it's like the streets call you:
"How could you leave me after all I done for you 
Who else would employ you  I made you feel royal
All it took was some oil, some water
Some baking soda to make you Hova"
My first taste of power, I'm numb off the feeling
I'm done off, niggas, I can't stop dealing

I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot


Ain't you afraid to go to jail  God
Well use your brain, are you sane 
But like Dale Earnhardt, the game is racing through my veins
And I crash every time, but like I never hit the wall
I need the K's like Pedro so I'm back pitching raw
And when the bases are loaded and cops try to squeeze play
The game ain't cold enough to ever freeze Jay
And I, need the green like fiends need yay'
And they, say it ain't right but it's the game of life


I'm addicted to the game
The shit keeps calling my name
I need to shoot


I rap now, I eat good
I smoke good, drink good
Multi-millionaire but still I think hood
Belly full, I can't shake it
The hunger in my belly has been replaced with other forms of starvation
I guess it's just the need to be heard
I need niggas to say, "I can't believe ya words"
I'm just an addict, addicted to music
Thoughts is sporadic, I gotta unconfuse it
Sort of like a Rubik's Cube is
Every album's a color, but I fuck up the other, color
Ha, I guess I'm more like
A bitch with a belly but her ass is right, haha
Y'all don't understand me still
I'll never enjoy my success but my family will
And I'm alright with that
So the rap Jerry Rice is back
To fulfill the need, though I lead the league
I pray everyday, I travel at God's Speed
Not a minute slower 'cause the minute you Hova
Everybody's praying for your spinach to slow up
It's sad but it's true, but niggas ass gon' turn blue
Holding your breath 'cause the force that's controlling my step
Won't let me lose it, 'til I'm undisputed
Until I'm one with the music
'Til I'm dead and gone, in search of the perfect song, mon mon
NoneHmmmm
I can t believe girl you are gone
After we ve been in love so very long
We were very much in love and that s all you re thinking of

Ooh baby now you re leaving me
I had many plans for two, I thought I could depend on you
Ooh, baby I guess we ll never be
Should I let my feelings stay 

I thought our love was her to stay 
I can t believe, girl, you are gone
After we ve been in love so very long
You were once so very kind, enjoyed to ease my troubled mind
Ooh baby now you re leaving me
The touch of your hand, a smile on your face since you ve been gone girl
I hardly know my place
Oh, should I let my feeling stay 
I thought our love was here to stay 

I can t believe girl you are gone
After we ve been in love so very long
We were very much in love, and that s all I m thinking of
Ooh, baby, now you re leaving me

I had many plans for two, I thought I could depend on you
Ooh, baby, I guess we ll never be
After you  leave, girl, after you re gone
Oh after you leave, girl, oh, after you re gone
Oh, after you leave girl, oh, after you re gone  
You ever want something
That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day, you get it
It's so good to you
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now, I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
'Cause ooh


Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away, hey


Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away

Ooh, I've got your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't see or come to me
When I call your name

I realize it's just a picture in a frame
I read your letters
When you're not near
But they don't move me
And they don't groove me
Like when I hear

Your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear


No other sound is quite the same
As your name

Your touch can do half this much
To make me feel better



Ooh, I got memories to look back on
Though they help when you're gone
I'm well aware

Nothing can take the place of your being there



Ain't nothing like the real thing, baby

Ain't nothing like the real thing

You do me wrong but still I'm crazy about you
Stay away too long and I can't live without you
Every chance you get you seem to hurt me more and more
But each hurt makes my love grow stronger than before
I know flowers go through rain
But how can love grow through pain  

]
Ain't that peculiar 

Peculiar as can be

Ain't that peculiar, baby

Peculiar-ality


]
You tell me lies that should be obvious to me 
I'm so much in love with you baby 'til I don't wanna see
That things you do and say are designed to make me blue
It's a doggone shame my love for you
Makes all your lies seem true
But if the truth makes love last longer
Why do lies make our love stronger

You made my soul a burning fire
You're getting to be my one desire
You're getting to be all that matters to me
And let me tell you girl
I hope and pray each day I live
A little more love I'll have to give
A little more love that's devoted and true
Cause all I do is think about you


All I do, is think about you 
All I do, is think about you

Baby just suppose I should happen to cross your mind
And by some chance a boy like me you're really been trying to find
Well let me tell you girl
Think of how exciting it would be
If you should discover you feel like me
If you should discover this dream is for two
We'll I'm gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
Cause all I do is think about you


All I do, is think about you 
All I do, is think about you


Gonna tell you girl
I'd light a candle every day
And pray that you'll always feel this way
And pray that our love will forever be new
I'm gonna tell you girl
If I cannot have you for my own
I'd rather be lonely and all alone
I'd rather keep thinking the way that I do
Cause all I do is think about you
Baby your love is every, everything to me, yeah
Hey yeah


All I do is think of you



Boy I know I was wrong
To push your love away
I was scared that you were too close to me
But now I find myself needing desperately
To see your smile, to feel your glare
Is what I want again
I know I trip, sometimes I slip
No more frontin' boy I want you back again
'Cause I


All I do is think of you day and night
All I do is trip on you every day and night, boy

All I do is think of you day and night

All I do is trip on you every day and night, boy

All I do think of you
Day and night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
All the time girl


I can't wait to get to school each day
And wait for you to pass my way
And bells start to ring
Any angel starts to sing
Hey that's the girl for you
So what are you gonna do
Hey little girl I love you so


All I do think of you day
And night that's all I do
I can't get you off my mind
I think about you all the time
All the time girl


I've been begun to take the long home
Just so I can be alone


'Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance



We drove closer, closer and closer
And even though we are almost there


You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes, imagine I am taking you away


Tonight


Come together all the people 
Here is your chance to make it right 


And even though we are getting close
We are not there just yet
And even though we are almost there
Cause this time of ours is borrowed
We must give a helping hand
Whatever happened to our hero's 
They must get another chance
We can do again
We draw close, closer and closer
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my lfie
You are all I dream, here at night
Close your eyes, imagine I'm taking you away tonight
Come together all the people
We can do it now
Here's your chance to make it right
Go and take a chance
And even though
And even though
We're getting close
Getting close
We're not there just yet
And even though we're almost there

You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream, here at night
Close your eyes, imagine I'm taking you away
And one more time close your eyes
I'm always here, to stay
Oh my
Tonight
Oh yeah
Now I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out, how high we can fly

There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare 
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done 
And you held out, you said no, you stand up


Only God knows
That it s all in the game
It s all in Your Name
Carry me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name


Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim

I like "You and me"
Okay, it's much more subtle, huh 
Yeah
Well, and it's open, yeah
Country
Yeah, country
Love it


Girl, I wanna fly with you
Late at night when the wind is free
We'll never let you go
Yeah Yeah


Won't you be my girl now x2
Girl now 


Won't you be my girlfriend
Won't be my love
 x2
I want to be your boyfriend
I want to be your love 
Yeah yeah yeah 
Ho!

I don't like it, baby
When you're stopping me on the floor
'Cause the more I keep on dancin'
The more I keep wanting some more


I don't care what you're saying
You're talking in my ear much too loud
And the music's taking my body
On a trip from nine to five
Keep me dancing

Wanna keep me groovin'

Rockin' and rollin'

Ain't nobody's business
 Woo!

I'm gonna dance up fire
I'm calling engine number 109
There ain't no chains to hold me
Gonna burn this place down till five

And you can't stop this fever
'Cause my temperature's burning hot, hot
And all I want to do is dance, dance
Sweating from my face to my feet

Keep me dancing

Ain't nobody's business but mine
We can walk away
But I turn my head to see if you would stay, baby
We can love the day
Then I am hoping that we throw those stones away
Baby, yeah


Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me waiting here 
Now you got me here in tears
Hold me

Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight 
It's gonna be all right
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight 
It's gonna be all right 
Everything is just fine
Everything will be just fine


All right


She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart
She is setting me free 
Whispers in the dark 
Unbreak my heart
You let it fall apart


Please stay this way
Don't you run away
I got a premonition 
Ooh girl, it burns just like the sun

You are the promised kiss of springtime
That makes the lonely winter seem long
You are the breathless hush of evening
That trembles on the brink of a lovely song
You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are


Someday, my happy arms will hold you
And someday, I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine

You are the angel glow that lights a star
The dearest things I know are what you are


Some, some, some, someday
My happy arms will hold you
And someday, I'll know that moment divine
When all the things you are, are mine
Yeah, yeah, all the things you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine
Someday you are, are mine
All the things you are, got to be mine

I was a fool too blind to see
I turned my back on all your needs
What a price

Yes, it's alright now, you see
I'll be all you'll ever need

Let me reach out and take your hand

You're the one
That I will love eternally

NoneAs he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She went underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down
It was her doom

Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie 
I really got to know if she's alright
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today

So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
He's leaving no clues, left behind him
And they have no way of knowing
Of the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations

Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie  
Annie, are you okay, are you okay, are you okay, Annie 

I really got to know if she's alright 
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright 
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright 
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today
Really got to know if she's alright 
Somebody tell me Annie's alright today

I'll give you love
The things you want
Ohhh... Ahh...
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you...


Sitting at home another lonely night
Wish you were here so I can hold you tight
Pain in my heart because I'm all alone
Why did you leave
Why did your love have to gooo
And I would do anything for you
I would
Thinking of ways that I could win your heart
But I'm so confused, I don't know where to start
Visions of love forever in my mind
I wait for the day when I can say that love's mine
'Cause I would do anything for you
Yes, I would

I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you


So what can I do to prove I need your love
What will it take because I won't give up
Open your heart and let your feelings show
'Cause deep down inside my heart just won't let you gooo
Girl, I would do anything for you
Yes, I would


I'll give you love
The things you want
Baby, there's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
I would do anything for you
I would do anything for you
I would do anything, girl, anything for you


So if there ever comes a time
When it's true love you hope to find
Just call out my name
And girl, that's when I would do anything

As I drove across on the highway, my jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped
Then got out and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"


Oh, take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to  a place without  no name


As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
At where kids are playin'
And people are laughin' and smilin' and nothin' to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness"
She turned around, looked down in my eyes
And started cryin'
Grab my hand, you've got a friend, oh

Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' Nothin' to fear

Oh
None
Boy I thought that I was trippin' when I asked you to stay
But now I know I was just crazy to let you treat me that way
I put you first in my life, you brought the worst to my life
And I'm tired of playing games with you just like a child
You had every opportunity to give me your smile
I can't do this no more
And how you broke me before
I just can't be around you and let you hurt me anymore


Every time I'm around you I let down my guard
So when I come around you I cover my heart
If I let you in again you'd only tear me apart
I don't want to do it again, I don't want to love you again
Can't be around you 

How can I consider taking you back again 
I trusted you and I'm bitter, I loved you more than I can
I put you first in my life, you brought the worst to my life
And I'm tired of laying alone wondering will he call home or come
And you'd apologize and make it seem alright
When you're not sorry at all
I can't see you no more, already tried that before
I just can't be around you, boy I'm closing the door


Every time I'm around you I let down my guard
So when I come around you I cover my heart
If I let you in again you'd only tear me apart
I don't want to do it again, I don't want to love you again
Can't be around you 


Anything you needed I was there for you
There was nothing I would not do
How could you leave me standing all alone 
Knowing I could not do this on my own
I can't do this no more, how you broke me before
I just can't be around you and let you hurt me anymore
Every time

Now it is "us", now it is "we"


Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They do not see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they did think again
If they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like Ben
Ooh-hoo


Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me

Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go


I used to say "I" and "me"

Always
Be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in shame
Always
Please be not always
And if always
Bow our heads in blame

'Cause time has made promises
Just promises

Faces
Did you see their faces 
Did they touch you 
Have you felt such pain 
To have nothing
To dream something
Then lose hoping
Is not life but lame 

But time has made promises
Just promises

Mothers cry, babies die
Helplessly in arms
While rockets fly and research lies
In progress to become
But what of men of flesh and blood 
We turn our backs on life
How can we claim to stand for peace
When the race is armed in strife
Destroying life 

Ben, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own

I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring
Our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever


I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around 
When things would hurt you, I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free 
When living seemed so hard to be
When things would hurt you


I am forever 
We are forever 


I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you", we are forever


I am the one who said that you are free
When living seemed so hard to be 
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around 
When all the walls came tumblin' down
When things would hurt you

I am your joy, your best of joy
I am the moonlight, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever


I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around 
When things will hurt you
I am forever

Wasn't it I who said that you are free 
When livin' seemed so hard to be, and things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever

I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other
We'll n ver part
Our love is from the h art
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever


I am the one who said that you are free
When it seems so hard to be the only one
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around 
When all the walls came tumbling down
When things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever


You are the sun that lights up the sky when things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
We are forever,  keep on, we are forever,  keep on, have to be strong
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am forever
I remember the first time I seen you moonwalk 
I believed I could do anything 
You made the world dance 
You made the music come to life


This the type of song that make the angels cry 
I look up in the sky and I wonder why  
Why you had to go, go
I know it's better on the other side 
You were chosen from the start 
We're never gonna let you go 
It's from my heart, woah-oh 


Who's Michael Jackson  You're Michael Jackson 
I'm Michael Jackson, we all Michael Jackson 
I guess what I'm askin' is, everybody bow their head for a legend
Don't breathe for a second 
Now let the air out, grab the hand of somebody you care about
So you can hear my message 
My confession, somebody tell Usher
I seen the moonwalk, I guess the young Thriller touched him
Like he touched me, like he touched you
So carryin' his legacy, somethin' I must do 
And I trust you lightin' candles, concrete visuals
Me and my brothers listenin' to Jackson 5 in our livin' room
First thing I did when I heard was call Puff
'Cause him and Mike tried to stop the beef between us 
Who was us  Me and 50, that beef is dead
Him and young Mike Jackson gon' take us to the ledge 

Gata cacheada eu te convido pra dan ar
Eu n o sei muito bem mas por ti posso tentar
E quando a gente cansar, n s para pra lanchar
Depois voltar a lan ar e passos e tu me encantar

Olhando nos seus olhos sinto tanta paz
A cada segundo c  me encanta mais
O Michael ou meu cora  o por ti
Fiquei em d vida agora, quem canta aqui 

C  balan a meu mundo eu grito "eita"
N o vamo parar at  tu ficar satisfeita
Eles n o ligam pra gente mas voc  n o ta sozinha
Garota perigosa, sei que c  ta na minha

Eu longe de voc    terror igual Thriller
Olhando nos seus olhos sempre viro um zumbi
Facilment  eu vejo minha postura sumir
Pra manter a imag m de "Bad" prefiro n o assumir

E se nossa m o por acaso se solta
Esperando estarei l , pois te quero de volta
Eu nem tenho olhos pra essas mina feiosa
Apenas pra voc , essa maravilhosa

I m playing people but it ain't a fucking game
I m making underrated records just to try and the get the fame
But is that really I want  Man I don t even know
I just want a bit of cash and then I wanna go and show
All of the people that ever doubted me, that I m running the game
And I do it barely trying man it s pretty insane
That I've been only rapping for about six months
But I'm already leagues above most of the rappers coming up
So
I'm stepping out my frame, and bitch you're gonna pay for it
I m making prayers and taking stares, I'm balling like a laker bitch
I take a pitch to make me rich, in which there's no mistaken it
I'm gonna leave you hanging just like you're a fucking Salem witch
Woah what a rhyme scheme, it s like a verbal crime scene
I m shattering and battering and bringing life to my dream
I'm touting all the talent shining light I m like a high beam
The people keep on doubting but I m melting em like ice cream
And that's a pretty sweet treat, I m gonna put it on repeat
And when I come and then I spit bitch you're gonna taste defeat
Because I m happy see me smiling, but I m still destroying tracks, and I love making all the music all I wanna do is rap
Cuz when I m rapping on a classic man I feel like I'm a GOAT
And bitch I'm only warming up just like I've got a winter coat
Man I'm the king of the castle, and you're just drowning in the moat
You can tell I'm gonna keep on sailing,you can't even float
I'm  Villainous, I m killing this, I m teaching you a syllabus
I'm like a private school if they weren't going out and billing us
Learn to speak some words and maybe learn to pronounce, then I can be the man that you can go on out and announce
The new arrival and revival of the entire rap game
No survival no reprisal for all you shitty wack lames
People keep on talking back I m gonna go and end em
That's all I have to say I don't need no addendum

Verse 1:
She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, don't mind
But what do you mean
She said am the one
She said am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round

Chorus:
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims am the one
Who claims am the one
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
But the kid is not my son
She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She said I am the one
Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. People always told me
Be careful of what you do. And don t go around
Breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me
Be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do
Cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she s in demand
Her schemes and plans. Go dance on
On the floor
In the round. So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice

She told my baby
We'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
His eyes were like mine 
Go dance
On the floor
In the round
People always told me
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son. She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover

Load up on guns, bring your friends
It's fun to lose and to pretend
She's overboard and self-assured
Oh no I know, a dirty word

Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello, how low
Hello, hello, hello

With the lights out it's less dangerous
Here we are now, entertain us
I feel stupid and contagious
Here we are now, entertain us
A mulatto, an Albino
A mosquito
My libido, yeah

(Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl that
Thinks I am the one
But the kid is not my son)

I'm worse at what I do best
And for this gift, I feel blessed
Our little group has always been
And always will until the end

Boy, is that girl with you 
Yes, we're one and the same


Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee!
But if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're Black or White, ooh!

So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean

Please handle the racism
Kids where never born with any hate in 'em
Let's pay attention, how we raise children
Underneath our skin there is no difference
Caught up in the system, spread love
Should be the mission, lets stop drifting apart
Make your mark, start doing your part
And shine like a star

Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life being a color

If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White


If I could recollect before my hood days
I sit and reminisce, thinking of bliss and the good days
I stop and stare at the younger
My heart goes to 'em, they tested with stress that they under
And nowadays things change
Everyone's ashamed of the youth
 cause the truth look strange
 Cause any day they'll push the button, and all good men like Malcolm X or Bobby Hutton died for nothin'
Don't it make you get teary  The world looks dreary
When you wipe your eyes see it clearly
There's no need for you to fear me
If you take your time and hear me
Maybe you can learn to cheer me
It ain't about black or white,  cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined

If you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're Black or White
It ain't about black or white,  cause we human
I hope we see the light before it's ruined


Tell me, do you see that old lady  Ain't it sad 
Living out of bags plus she's glad for the little things
She has
And over there, there's a lady, crack got her crazy
Guess who's giving birth to a baby
I don't trip or let it fade me
From out of the frying pan we jump into another form of slavery
Even now I get discouraged
Wonder if they take it all back, will I still keep the courage 
I refuse to be a role model
I set goals, take control, drink out my own bottles
I make mistakes but learn from every one
And when it's said and done
I bet this brother be a better one
If I upset you don't stress, never forget
That God isn't finished with me yet
Before we find world peace
We gotta find peace and end the war in the streets;

One morning, I came across a star
Trying to find her way back home
As the day changed, it rained
And she said


Just look into the water
There's no better place to be, uh huh
It will take you to that Blackstreet
Where things change
It's nothing bad, it's nothing better
Oh, Blackstreet
Take me there 
Take me there 
I wanna go, I've gotta go, I
Take me there 
Take me there 
Can you take me there 

Welcome to Blackstreet




Feel this
Twelve cars, mansion, beautiful kids
Fly life, my life
Wanna be here to see it on tv
Listen to my cd easily
Dough flow, blow, do the show, all across the globe
Lotta carats in my earlobe, chillin' 20 million
Wanna jam with my ghetto's Blackstreet heroes
Do they thing, whatcha got 
New jack swing, teddy stay ready
Deadly on the remix
I'm the prefix and suffix, got enough chips
Not enough hits though, don't get it twisted
Over a hundred of mine listed, why 
K-sick widdows and six zeroes in the blink of a eye
In the game I'm ahead of, spread love, call my fleet
When I break bread, we all'll eat
That's how we play from Motown to VA
T.r., mad pr, cuban cigar, never illegal
None of y'all equal, peek-a-boo, I see you
Now I'll leave you with just a little sneak preview
You know how we do, music for the people
Ha
Go on
Doggone
Aaow!

She drink till you mind
She drink till you faint
You walking the line
She making you stay
She keeping the count
She making you pay
She ready again
Get ready again
She haunts you, boy
Oooh, she needs you, boy
Oooh, she wants you, boy
Oooh
Don't you see 
She got me thinking

Black widow woman, you're dirty, baby
In a web of seduction
Stop lying, baby
She's a lucky filled woman
She's something to see
You're dirty, you're funky
She's the one, the one for me
Ain't no friend of me
The one, the one for me

She fed you a lie
You bought it this time
Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha-Ha
Connecting the dots
Wish you would've declined
The look in your eyes, you're telling me so
The truth is unlearned
The truth is untold

Ha!
Gone!
Doggone
Aouw!


She drink to your mind
She drink to your fate
You walkin' the line
She makin' you stay
She keepin' the count
She making' you pay
She ready again
Get ready again


She wants you, boy 
She needs you, boy 
She haunts you, boy 
Don't you see, she got me thinking


Black widow woman 
In a web of seduction 
She's a lucky filled woman
She's something to see 
She is the one, the one for me 

My baby's always dancing
And it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no loving
And that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco
Went to every kind of disco
From that night I kissed
Our love goodbye


Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on sunshine
Don't blame it on moonlight
Don't blame it on good times
Blame it on the boogie


That nasty boogie bugs me
But somehow it has drugged me
That spellbound rhythm gets me
Off my feet
It's changed my life completely
I've seen the lightning l ave me
My baby just can't take
H r eyes off me

Hee-hee-hee-hee!
My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye


Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie

That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me


Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie 
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie


I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't 
I just can't  control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet
I just can't, I just can't
I just can't control my feet

My baby's always dancin' and it wouldn't be a bad thing
But I don't get no lovin' and that's no lie
We spent the night in Frisco at every kinda disco
From that night I kissed our love goodbye


Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie


That nasty boogie bugs me, but somehow how it has drugged me
Spellbound rhythm gets me on my feet
I've changed my life completely, I've seen the lightning leave me
And my baby just can't take her eyes off me


Don't blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie
Don't you blame it on the sunshine
Don't blame it on the moonlight
Don't blame it on the good times
Blame it on the boogie, woo



Bleib' schlau
Bulle kommt, ich lauf' um die Ecke
Rein, raus, Br der da unten nehm'n deine Packets
Verkauf' Baba-Shit, es geht um Investment
5-0, komm testen, war schon immer hier im Westen


Vier Unzen Lean in der Sprite, damit ich abk hl' 
Tief drin' in der Trap, Mann, du wei t nicht, wie sich das anf hlt
Ich such' Bands
Du bist immer noch kein Nigga, der wen anr hrt
Wir sind alle CEOs, wir brauchen kein'n, der uns anf hrt 
Eine Sache geht schief und er schmei t direkt das Handtuch 
Ganze Nacht aktiv, wart' seit Stunden auf ein'n Anruf 
Kein Benchpress, aber tausende von Gramm
Ich kann sehr viel f r dich, doch ich werd' sicher nicht dein Mann 
Ich bin smoked-out
Wohnung von 'ner Chaya und verwandel' es zum Dope-House
 berall, wo ich hin gehe, tauch' ich mit den Bros auf 
Wir stapeln heute Bands, Mann, wir sehen nicht mehr broke aus
Investier'n mit der Gang und du gibst es nur f r Hoes aus
Du redest viel, wir hab'n dein Vorschuss in 'nem Trap-House 
Ich rauch' mir zehn Gram semi-dry und pass' out
Ich bin doppel B
Mach' ich mal ein'n Hit, dann hol' ich Gang raus
Ruf mich, wenn du Dry, Lean, Percys oder Xans brauchst

I try to do what's right for me
But no one sees the way I see
And then I try to please them so
But, how far can this pleasing go 


Something's soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself


Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find a person like you, you're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times


Sometimes I cry 'cause I'm confused
Is this a fact of being used 
There is no life for me at all
'Cause I give myself at beck and call


Something's soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
'Cause life is being happy yourself

I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone


Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel

Look out!
Can we get out of here 
No, I'm enjoying this
Conductor, we have a problem
Conductor, we have a problem
Conductor, conductor, we have a prob 


Gemstar razor rippin' you
You're minuscule, gettin' paid work I weighed on the Supreme digital 
I eat you niggas food 
I played the lower all night, gettin' right, sellin' a broken down '62 
Now it's autographs, lump sums from rap residuals
I know seein' me style is makin' you niggas miserable 
Keep watchin' my moves, you gon' be suicidal
I'm the God, I always knew to never worship idols
You th  champ I blow the wig off, who hold the title 
And spill th  of blood my rival all over his bible
Zip ties on my Off-White Nike shoe
Properly flip pies, clique with guys that'll knife you 
Who don't speak much, read body language and move smart
Keep a chrome trey-pound to match the Chrome Hearts
Pay me on time, all hundreds, like I'm a loan shark
Mommy said, "You should be rich already, think you so smart"
Before monetary, I was wealthy in the mind already
Playin' first to execute millions, I need many
You niggas hopeless and your pockets got pennies with holes
Your attempt to copy is sloppy, we broke the mold 
I had coke, I made the fiends go blow for blow
Whoever win overdose, you niggas know we're close

Ha 
One brick, two brick, three 
Ah


Syrup in the Sunkist 
You know who run shit , kilo rappers unzipped 
I mean, they probably did somethin', but they ain't done this 
They shot the plug whip
He died in the parking lot, with like a hundred bricks 
I got the news, was out in Paris, it fucked up my trip 
Like, why he couldn't get killed after the drop-off  
We got the Maybach truck outside the Mondrian
They like, "You doin' cocaine numbers with that vinyl, huh " 
Yeah, bitch, I took that wax and went Daniel-san 
I dove head first in the blocks
Had the bread stuffed in a box, flame so hot, I dropped the pot
I caught it and the cookie still was good, I'm Magic Johnson
If we holdin' Ace bottles on the couch, we got the choppers in 
Ooh, the feds comin' 
Turn the phones off, the feds comin' 
Them niggas hangin' out the window ain't tryna dead nothin' 
Them niggas ain't  Stove, nigga 


This rap shit got me back, I swear to God it's a blessin'
We still toxic like Rodman and Carmen Electra
I'm puttin' 'em all in a shredder, my bars gettin' better
I'm talkin' slickest raindrops fallin' off a umbrella
That's what happens when them bullshit rumors get back to me 
It's like givin' a arsonist matches and gasoline, nigga
I'm on your neck like that tank on Master P, nah
Nigga, I'm on your neck like the tag on tees
Coach called me in to play, I stopped playin' the bench 
My baby mama made a post and I stopped payin' the rent 
My watch hand like, "Goddamn, the clock hand at six"
Won't get a word out of whoever I hand a brick
I'm a hustler, so I can deliver if you got a order 
'Cause they got rich off shit that was free, like bottled water
Who there when your dollars shorter  
I'm like KD in free agency, countin' offers
And I won't take a dollar shorter 
You'd probably be up too if you had some rich partners
Compressors make packs shrink like a witch doctor
I'm a fit shopper, brick locker, a whip copper 
WNBA, score on her and then block her 
Uh-huh, these for the boys that I made a man
Hustlers I handed they first packs and gave a chance
If you're lookin' for a hustle and need you a stable plan
I suggest you stand next to the God like Abraham 
Butcher, nigga , let's go

People tellin' me, you've got another guy
I've been abused, watch me light the fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothin' but big lies

He had his whole life in front of him
A man with a dream
But those dreams, they had all come to an end
And left us all pained
A high school in mourning, a community supporting
On the 17th of November, we lost us a friend
And now, as I walk, through the valley of death
I know that your lungs have been filled with the Lord's breath
And although you have left this Earth
You have never left our hearts or our prayers
We may be different schools, different cities, different mayors
But in a tragedy we are one
One valley, one community, one heart beating
Our hearts beating, but slowly breaking
We can't forget about you
We can't forget about you
No, we can't forget about you, nah

United we stand
Divided we fall
That's how it is in the brotherhood
In the brotherhood, brotherhood
Forever we'll stay
Together and strong
Growin' up in the brotherhood
In the brotherhood, brotherhood


Brothers are your best friends
By your side until the end
Always there to lend a hand
And do all they can
See, brothers stand tall
All for one and one for all
I'll do all that a brother could
To make it good in my brotherhood


United we stand
Divided we fall

Beautiful in every way
Despite everything you deal with on an everyday-
Basis, God made you fearfully
Wonderfully crafted in His hands, You are His masterpiece
Imagine the smile on His face when He said, it is good
A mirror image reflecting His beauty
He kept you truly preserved for me
I ll never be fully able to express my thanks
Get a taste of His goodness when I see your face,  baby
For the rest of my days, I am yours, and you are mine
No valley low is ever too deep not to see the shine of the sun-rise
In the morning we ll find joy in the son
Find peace in the storm, through whatever is going on
Find love in my arms, find serenity like Psalms 23
In the midst of enemies, Lobster is all we ll eat
Crab legs, your favorite kind of meat
Theres a table prepared for you and me
As we sing goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days of the week, of the month, of the  year
Knowing perfect love casts out all fear
I thank God for you, for the type of woman you are
Wishing on a star couldn t get it right
Nor birthday wishes, only God could ve
I promise you, blowing out candles
The breath of God breathed all over you
Anointed woman of God
I see God in you when I look in your eyes
It s no wonder I am drawn to you
Im called to you, your called to me
Stuck together by the bond of peace
I declare,  nothing will get between this love
Many children s what well be bringing up
Peace and love surrounding us forever more
As we surrender more and more
Going deeper and deeper and further from the shores
Like Ezekiel  forty-seven four
Been led by your Spirit Lord
And I found a good thing
There is too much more too explore
So I got you that diamond ring
So I guess I m forever yours
On September 17th
Until forever more, even unto Eternity
Even unto eternity

I caress you, let you taste the just so blissful, lips then
I would give you anything baby
Ah, just to make my dreams come true
Aow baby, you give me butterflies


Saw you, baby
You tonight, now
You give me 
'Cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I


Tells ya, babyNoneListen...

Verse:
When you re sad and depressed
I will be here to put a smile on your face
When you re hurt and in tears
I will be here to mend all of your pain

When you re lonely, have no one
I will be here to comfort you
Cause no one should be solo
They shouldn t be down and blue

Chorus:
See I, I love you
I want nothing but the best for you
I ll stand by your side and say  Let us be strong! 
I ll do all the things a true fri nd would do
I ll stand by your side through the right & the wrong

V rse 2:
When you're lost in confusion
When you feel like you're going crazy
I will help you figure it out
I will be here to bring you back to sanity
None
There was time taken out from me
To do things that I couldn't see
This doesn't seem to be a place for me
In the size of your bigger scheme
So baby call off

Now you've started messin' with my mind
That must have been your plan all the time
You must have thought that I was blind
I didn't gave to look that hard to find
So baby call off
So now we know the final score
I've got no time to play your games
Don't think that I can take it anymore
Why don't you take your bags and hit
So baby call off
Call of the wild
Call of the wild
Call of the wild


People tell me this
And people that me that
Ooh, everybody thinks they know
Where it's at
And life is getting harder
And it's tearing me down
It's time to pack my bags
I'm gonna leave this town

The call of the wild is calling me
The wilderness is beckoning me
The call of the wild is calling me
Where nature moves over the free


Call of the wild
Call of the wild
Call of the wild


And people quibbling this
And people quibbling that
Ooh, the ones with the money
Just keep on getting fat
There ain't no solitude
The quiet's getting loud
Any place you want to go
Gotta fight right through the crowd


The call of the wild is calling me
The wilderness is beckoning me
The call of the wild is calling me
Where nature moves over the free
The earth and the sky and the sea
The valleys of signs you can see
The call of the wild is calling me
The call of the wild is calling me
The wilderness is beckoning me
The call of the wild is calling me
Where nature moves over the free
The earth and the sky and the sea
The valleys of signs you can see...
There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can I do but wait for you 
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live

But if it gets too rough
Call on me


Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need


If you can't get enough
Call on me


I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too


So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere

There goes the sunshine
Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can i do but wait for you

Can I see you

Like I see you late tonight
Come and hold me
Come and hold me
Come and make me feel alright
In the morning
Can I see you in the morning 


Can I see you in the morning
Must I get down on my knees 
Come and take me
Come and take me
Do with me just what you please
Just a short walk in the sunshine
In the open side by side 
Chance to hold you
Chance to hold you
Chance to hold my head up high
In the morning

Oh, girl
I can't get ready 
Oh oh oh girl
I can't get ready 
Ooh hoo hoo hoo 
No, no, no
I can't get ready 
For losing you 
Girl, I can't get ready , no, no, no
For losing you 
Oh, can't get ready 
No, girl for losing you 
Losing you 

Thought I had your love in the palm of my hands
But I let it slip away from me, girl
And now you're happy with another guy 
Someone who doesn't make you cry 
And now it's got me shedding tears
Oh girl, how I wish you were here


'Cause I can't get ready 
No, for losing you , no, no, no
I can't get ready 
Oh girl, for losing you , no, no, no
Can't get ready , oh girl, for losing you
Losing you 
Losing you 


Girl, I took your love for granted
I know, I know, I treated you so unkind
And now the shoe is on the other foot

And you don't even take a second look 
You told me there would come a time
Oh girl, it's really blowing my mind

I thought she had to have it
Since the first time she came
Who knows the situation
Mysteries do remain
And now I wonder why
I break down when I cry
Is it something I said
Or is it just a lie  
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true 

If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away


I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let, I can't let her get away


I tried to mastermind it
By saying let you be
But everytime I did it
The hurt came back at me
I told you that I need you
A thousand times and why
I played the fool for you
And still you said goodbye 

I can't let, I can't let her get away 

Tried to fight 
I got the 

I got the feeling,  that she wanna breakdown
I got the feeling, that she wanna get away
I got the feeling, she never gonna

How the fuck she gonna stop me 
I got the feeling, that she's never gonna drop me
I got the feeling, bout' she never stop with me
I got the feeling, but she never gonna

Just do it, do it
And I know she'll be the death of me
At least we'll both be numb
And she'll always get the best of me
The worst is yet to come
This I know, yeah, this I know


She told me, "don't worry about it"
She told me, "don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" 
People always told me, "Be careful" as
She told me you'll never be alone, oh, oh



I can't feel my face when I'm with you

I can't feel my face when I'm with you

I can't feel my face when I'm with you

I can't feel my face when I'm with you


I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
Feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
Who danced on the floor in the round
None

Wanna jam on the dance floor till it ends huh
Tight buttocks get a lot of attention

Can't stop staring, you're fine as hell
Got my shades on though I ain't playin' myself
Mad dudes with doughs, clock your flows

Got your dudes with the Lex and the Roves
Striking a pose, but everybody knows you want me

But play it any lower and you won't know me
Cause I'm out the door for sure approach me

Why you in the V-I, E-V-E too fly to drop by
Get up off your clothes and cruise by
Shades high, nothing while you're with bluffing your team
Every time I'm with you blushing, your smile gleam
You don't think I know you noticing me
Come on get closer to be, be bold take a dose of the Eve
If you're ready for your part, cause I'm 'bout to depart
I'm your life for the rest of the night, I'm breaking hearts

Yo get your hot self over here

No one to call my own
So girl, I love you 
Don't you know I love you 

Like for you 
Hey, can you remember

And the time we shared

In the grass, yeah

The time we had 
And the time we shared 

We're sitting in the grass, playing in the grass...
She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd, oh-oh


I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination 
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories

She's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd


I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away


Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me

You gain affection after everyone you see
He s In a different nation, he s overseas
Love and dedication are out of your reach
Why do you take control of everyone and me
Your mind seems like a Picasso painting
The friend group is barely remaining
And you re still campaigning, going after the remaining
Damn this shit has become so straining
You don t let lovers even get to first base
Say you love someone then you spit in their face
First every member then all the human race
Even to your own mother, you re a disgrace


Cause you re, dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine

Centipede

Centipede


Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire


I feel a longing for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch


Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears





Your love is like a raging fire
You're a snake that's on the loose
The strike is your desire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire
But when the centipede is hot
You're bound to feel the fire


I feel a longing for your touch
Like you crawled into the bathroom window
To give him all your love
Like a centipede that's hot
The fire is in your touch
Like a centipede you've got
A lot of loving to touch


Don't you know
In the quiet of the night
When the snake is in the crawling
And the moon starts to glow
Then disappears
When the time is really right
Is when the centipede is crawling
He'll be crying in the night
So many tears
]
Hoo hoo, listen darlin', yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah 
Ooh yeah 
Ooh

]
It seemed like yesterday
That you were in my arms
And in a special way
You touched my heart with all your charms
And now you're gone 
And I find myself 
Baby, I'm all alone 
And there's no love left 
Hey, hey! Don't know where I failed
It seems I always cared
And I did all I know
To win your love and make it so
You always stay but you turned away 
Honey, what could I say 
How could you, how could you do me this way 


'Cause I'm chained
To your love and affection
Chained with my heart in my only direction
None
Oooh
What  Ho!
Get back on me

Have you seen my Childhood 
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart

No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me


People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood
I've never known


Have you seen my Childhood 
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne

Before you judge me
Try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask

Have you seen my childhood 
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart

Have you seen my childhood 
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart, then ask
Have you seen my childhood 

Many of our world's problems today
Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that


Have you seen my Childhood 
I'm searching for the world that I come from

People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood 


When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts


People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood  I've never known


Have you seen my Childhood 
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly

Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had
Children of the Light, ohh
Children of the Light, ohh

People work and people talk
And think that their alive
But ask them what their lifes about
Their quick to run and hide
People laugh and people cry
But never realize
That all the worlds tomorrows lays in what they feel inside
So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light

Walk together
All of my brothers, walk together
All of my sisters, walk forever
All of my children, children smile
The time has come for everyone
To stop and look around
To see just where we started from
And wonder where we're bound
The ship we're on has lost it's way
So, take my hand
And walk in the sunshine
Take my hand, from out of the night
We can stand, despite all of the dark lies
A we can build a world that is right
We can be the children of the light
Everybody!

Merry Christmas, everybody
Yeah, Merry Christmas everybody, big deal
Hey man, what's wrong with you Jermaine 
Yeah, that's no kind of attitude
This only happens once a year
Hey, fellas, don't bug him
He and his girl just broke up, so get off his back
Can't you see there's tears in his eyes 
Yeah, he's cryin', look he's cryin'
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry

Christmas won't be the same this year
Without her loving arms holding you so near
Christmas won't be the same this year

Without her loving arms holding you so near


I see the lights
But they don't shine for me
I see the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
Our house decorated
My friends are celebrating

Christmas won't be the same this year

Without her loving arms holding you so near

Christmas won't be the same this year

Without her loving arms holding you so near



The neighborhood kids
Are having so much fun
Counting off the days
'Til Santa Claus comes
And I see the Mistletoe
Hanging from my door
I wish I could kiss you again
Like I did before

Fairytale make believe in you
Fairytale make believe in you


Cinderella, stay awhile
You are the one
That I have been looking for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall
Midnight is so near
Please do not disappear
Now that you are here
Stay awhile


Cinderella, I just know
That the magic slipper's
Gonna fit
Cinderella, do not go
You're my princess
I am sure of it

This is love for sure
Love that is sweet and pure
Love that will endure
Stay awhile


When you speak the angels all sing
This is the kind of magic you bring, oh


Cinderella, stay awhile
This is like a fairytale with you
Cinderella, when you smile
All my fairy tales are coming true

Look, all this shit better pay off in the end
I ain't staying up til 3AM everyday with a pen
Just to wake back up at 7 with my head aching again
And have to get ready for work and then begin faking a grin, nah
I m working harder than anybody I know
And I don't mean no disrespect but it's getting harder
To show the happiness I displayed like everyday back before
Cause I can hide it pretty good, I always keep it on the low
But I feel I m gonna bust outta the seams
I feel like nothing's happening and it's crushing all my dreams
I always dream of waking up in a crib with white curtains
Opening to a view of the city and I got no problems even
If I be thinking still, I got a few dollars
Maybe like even 50 mill, my family healthy, whip clean
Woman bad, got a Grammy shelf with 16 other plaques
Then I awaken and still ain't nothing changes
I'm in hell, that's way far from the City of Angels
I go to turn on a song to make me feel a little safer
But I keep hearing this same evil song on all of the stations
I try to switch it but the force keeps taunting me
I turn it off but that voice still haunting me
I don't know what's going on but it s possessing my soul
Man, this is how that little song goes


You ain t ever gonna get what you want in this life
You're just gonna die a lonely young man
And even if you got what you want
I ma make sure that you lose it, I'm your only one friend
You can't get rid of me
You have to do what I say, if you get this life
You're gonna lose either way, so it s best you don't
I suggest you don't try, cause if you do
I'm just gonna eat you from the inside
After school when I walked down your street
I could start to feel the sidewalks beneath my feet
Although you're not here, I feel your love is near
Won't you come outside
I don't have time to play hide and seek
And I can't wait til the midnight hour

Why don't you try something new
Before it gets old, don't let it get cold
Come and get it, come and get it 
Burning for ya, yearning for ya filled with desire
Come and get it, come and get it 
Burning for ya, yearning for ya filled with desire

Just one kiss you put on my lips
I felt the tingle right down to my finger tips
I'm at the point of no return
I can't put out the fire that you started burning
I don't have time to play hide and seek
And I can't wait til the midnight hour

Why don't you try something new
Before it gets old, don't let it get cold
Come and get it, come and get it 
Burning for ya, yearning for ya filled with desire
Come and get it, come and get it 
Burning for ya, yearning for ya filled with desire
None
Now you say every time you need some affection
The one you love goes in another direction
You just sit back in a daze, reminiscing
'Cause you know some other lips he's been kissing


Now when you need the love he'll never show you
Come around here
And when you need some loving arms to hold you
Come around here


Now, I may not be the one you want

But I know I'm the one you need

Say now, I may not be the one you want

But I know I'm the one you need



Your life stands still
The minute he goes
You count the hours
Just hoping he shows

One thing I can tell you is you got to be free


Come together, right now

He's got walrus gumbo
He's got Ono sideboard
He one spinal clacker
He's got feet down through his knees
Hold you in his arms till
You can feel his disease

Sun is in the sky
Shining everywhere
But I don't see the light
And no one seems to care
That's why I'm packing up again
Gotta leave this empty life
Got a ticket in my hand
So look for me tonight


Baby, I'm coming home, coming home
Coming home 
So happy I'm coming home, coming home
Where I belong

You could say hello 
And make me feel alive 
Ooh, Heaven only knows 
Happy tears will fill my eyes
Oh, you could turn away
And make me wanna cry
Tell me it's too late
But I got to know I tried

Now if you in ya legend, shoot this up to ten

You told me you loved me
You told me you cared
You told me you needed me
But I guess those were words
Without meaning


Tu m'as dit fais moi confiance
Tu mentais si bien
J' avais foi en ta parole
Plus que tout, je voulais
Croire en ces mots


Tu m'as dit je t'aime tant
Tu l'as dit souvent
You said, "Boy, please, toi et moi, c'est pour la vie"


You said together we'd be
For the rest of our lives
You said that you hoped and dreamed
But I guess thos  were words
Without meaning

Somebody shakes when the wind blows
Somebody's missing a friend, hold on
Somebody's lacking a hero
And they have not a clue
When it's all gonna end, again


Stories buried and untold
Someone is hiding the truth, hold on
When will this mystery unfold 
And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries 

You can change the world 
You can touch the sky 
You're the chosen one 
If we all cry at the same time tonight


People laugh when they're feeling sad
Someone is takin' a life, hold on
Respect to believe in your dreams
Tell me where were you
When your children cried last night 


Faces fill with madness, oh
Miracles unheard of, hold on
Faith is found in the winds
All we have to do
Is to reach for the truth, the truth


You can change the world 
You can touch the sky 
You're the chosen one 
If we all cry at the same time tonight
NoneYou will, be missed, by all your fans
I clenched, my fists, but this' so hard to withstand
If I had the power to change one thing, I'd bring you back today
But life's not promised and that won't change
Im'a meet you there some day

In this lifetime I wanna thank you, for showing me the man in the mirror
In this lifetime I wanna thank you, you motivated the whole world to deliver
We cry out of joy  
We cry out of joy
There's so much joy in our heart
Oh I wish, the world could see you the way I did
And I wish, they witnessed how a wonderful dad you were to all your kids
And I noticed it didn't stop there, saving childr n was one of your goals
Just donating all of your millions, so they could one day rul  the world

I can't believe my eyes
They're wearin' a disguise
They wanna take control
My body and my soul
They feel it every time
You give to me to crime

I had the strangest dream
I was a demon's toy
Why won'tcha let me be

They locked me in a cage
Just feels me up with rage


Never before have I ever complained
Livin' my life neither demon nor saint
Seein' my anger becomin' a sin
Reach for the danger my evil twin


Danger is the game
No chance to get away
You got to play withem'
You gotta fuse with me
Danger is to blame
Go back from where you came



Why did you call me dead
Why don't you set me free
Why won't you let me be
 fire
A lover
What did you really see



Never before have I ever complained
Livin' my life neither demon nor saint
Seein' my anger becomin' a sin
Reach for the danger my evil twin

The way she came into the place, I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room, I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive, the girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was walkin' the line 
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time" 
She said "Don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone" 
My baby cried, she left me standin' alone 

She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous 
Take away my money, throw away my time
You can call me honey, but you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections with the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love, I was at the point of no return
Deep in the darkness of passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive, this girl I could not trust
The girl was bad, the girl was dangerous


I never knew but I was livin' in vain 
She called my house, she said "You know my name"

"And don't you pretend you never did me before"
 
With tears in her eyes, my baby walked out the door
 
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous

One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free

I never knew but I was walking the line 
"Come go with me", I said, "I have no time"

Like we really used to before we met in the fall
Back in the day when my youth was golden
We really had it all, oh


Hold me like you really used to
A summer's day in Gloucestershire
The view is changing
See them laughing, in their gardens
I wish that we ll see Gloucestershire
I wish that we'll see Gloucestershire
I wish that we'll see Gloucestershire, again


Ahh, oooh, ahhhh
Da da da, da da da da-aa


Hold me like you really used to before we met in the fall
Back in the day when my youth was golden
We really had it all, oh


Hold me like you really used to
A summer s day in Gloucestershire
The view is changing
See them laughing, in their gardens
I wish that we'll see Gloucestershire
I wish that we'll see Gloucestershire, again

You'll never make me stay so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes, she touchin' me so to start
She say there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...


She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtains come down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star


Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...

She wrote: "Dear Michael
You'll probably never get this letter, Michael
I wrote you a hundred times before
Knowing how I feel, I'll write a hundred more"


"Dear Michael 
Every time  your record's on, Michael 
I close my eyes  and sing along
Dreaming you're singing to me"


And then, she wrote: "Michael, I love you
I've held the tears back long as I can
I'm sealing my feelings in this envelope
'Cause I wanna be more than just your number one fan"


I'm gonna answer your letter 
I'll start beginning  with the ABC's of loving you 
Your letter  really touched my heart
I've been dreaming of
Meeting the picture that you sent along
Signed with all your love

Ooh la la la
I'm sayin' ooh la la
To let you know it's real, yeah
Ooh la la la
I'm sayin' ooh la la
To show just how I feel


You came to me, when I was sad and lonely
In need of a love so faithful and true
Now all my bad days are gone
Thanks to you, good times have won
I found a best friend in you

Juliet had a Romeo
Wherever she'd go, he would follow
Feelin' so much deeper than love
You and me share a heart of gold
Better than that, we share our soul
Feelin' so much deeper than love
And I say...


Ooh la la la
I'm sayin' ooh la la
To let you know it's real, yeah
Ooh la la la
I'm sayin' ooh la la
To show just how I feel


I am your lady and I
Will always stand by your side
Hold tight when you need my hand
Together we're so strong
We'll make sweet love all night long
I am so proud you are my man


You're my man
How I feel
Is so real
Come to me
And set me free
I am yours
For all times
'Cause you show me you're all mine, yeah
You're all mine
You're mine


None
In this world there's much confusion
And I've taste the city life and it's not for me
Now I do dream of distant places
Where, I don't know now, but it's destiny


If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things


I want destiny 
It's the place for me
Give me the simple life
I'm getting away from here
Let me be me
C'mon let me feel free


Now I'm a man that's for all seasons
And what the city offers me ain't naturally
I look to greet the stars but there are no stars to see
I'm gonna search this world until I find my destiny


If it's the rich life, I don't want it
Happiness ain't always material things

Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough


I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"


Annie, are you okay 
So, Annie, are you okay  Are you okay, Annie 
Annie, are you okay 
So, Annie, are you okay  Are you okay, Annie 
Annie, are you okay 
So, Annie, are you okay  Are you okay, Annie 
Annie, are you okay 
So, Annie, are you okay  Are you okay, Annie 
Annie, are you okay 

Will you tell us that you're okay 
There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you   a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Why do you judge me if
You don't know me 
I might look back to you
But inside i'm good. 
Get to know me first
And what's my inside
Take a closer look
At my personality
Reddish hair or blonde
Or black what matters 
You can't define me from
What's my skin color
I might be tall or short
But I'm still myself
Focus on who I am
And not my outside

Nobody's the same and that's fine!
Her eyes, her hair, her hands are all

I must be free to complete

Nobody's the same and that's fine!
You can do whatever you
Wish to and everyone's scared to be different;
But that's what makes us all unique 
Haha!


We are all equal no matter our look
Skirts, long jeans, high heels
They all reflect us!
But that's who we are
And how we show it
 reveal, our true nature


Nobody's the same and that's fine!
Our eyes, our hair, our hands are all

I must be free to complete
If you want me
I'll be there in a flash
If you need me
Well that's different at last
Say it-no delay
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you
You got me saying'
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo
I'm here to please you
In every way I can
To prove to you
That I'm your only man
Trying, no denying
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you
You got me sayin'
Woo woo woo woo woo woo woo

Chorus:
I searched this world
For a different kind of girl
I caught myself going girl shopping
No matter what I do
I keep running back to you
Saying you're all mine
Different kind of lady
The way I love you
In case you'd like to know
You're a lady
And that's a different show
You're meant for me
That makes you different, you see
Cause everything I do
Is always up to you
Cause you're a different kind of lady
Cause you're a different kind of lady
Cause you're a different kind of lady

You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be 
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me
She's saying "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says "There's no turning back"
She trapped me in her heart

Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

Oh no, oh no, oh no


She likes the boys in the band

Who promise fortune and fame

You ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me 
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never would leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, "That s okay"
Protect my heart with that rod
I m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark
I see she won't leave me  lone
She slashed the tires on my car
Billie Jean

Who's bad 


She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round "
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round


People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" 
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" 


Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Hoo!
Doctor, my eyes have seen the years
And the slow parade of fears without crying
Now I want to understand

I have done all that I could
To see the evil and the good without hiding
You must help me if you can

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what is wrong
Was I unwise to leave them open for so long

'cause I have wandered through this world
And as each moment has unfurled
I've been waiting to awaken from these dreams
People go just where they will
I never noticed them until I got this feeling
That it's later than it seems

Doctor, my eyes
Tell me what you see
I hear their cries
Just say if it's too late for me

Doctor, my eyes
Cannot see the sky
Is this the prize for having learned how not to cry
You better stop
You are dogging around
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because if you do not stop
I am going to have to put you down


I cannot take it much longer
My heart is getting weak
It is not getting any stronger
You keep me so upset
My head is in a whirl
But if you want to be, yeah
Be my girl


You better stop
You are dogging around
You know what I am talking about
Yeah, yeah, yeah
If you do not stop
I am gonna have to put you down
Baby, yes I do, yes I do
Gonna to put you down
You are dogging me
I am going to have to put you down, yeah

I know that life can make it hard today
When the one you love is gone away
But you have to be strong--you must carry on life, love, mhm
Although time sees that you won't forget
There is always light shining bright within
And we must always understand
Our love is stronger than a man
And wider than all of his love

Stand tall, keep striving to be positive
In your memories love will always win
Keep your visions clear and bright
Just take control of life
I see the sadness that you feel inside
Wipe your tears away, hold your head up high
Believe in love, believe in hope
And trust that you will survive
And find your piece of mind

From another pretty miss
My baby was the price that I paid

None
Wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing


You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me


All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door


It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say


I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to go and put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin'

Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night

Ay, I'ma start it like this
When it comes to me man, I'm a hit or a miss
I need a girl that's gon' ride for me
Not a girl that's gon' turn around and lie to me 
We stay fighting, man, there ain't no chill
Puttin' up with you takin' all my power of will
No Jaden
They be coming for me, but feelin' jaded
Man, I've had one too many, I'm so faded
Look, you can say it ain't true
But I've been thing 'bout where we stand, me and you
We ain't workin', girl, face the facts
Girl, relax before, you know, my face gets smacked
'Cause I was giving you the full court press
And all that in return, you was giving me stress
And I thought our love was so strong
We throwing hands instead of bands, where did we go wrong 


All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door

Girl, don't you say; girl, don't you say, ooh
Girl, don't you make; girl, don't you make, ooh
Make me cry
Make me cry

]
You had my life 
In the palm of your hand 
Why you threw it away, I'll never ever understand
You took away the best part 
The best part of me
You took away you
How cruel could you be

You're just another heartache I've got to learn to take
You're just another habit I have to learn to break
Am I alone again 
Am I alone again 
Am I alone, alone, alone...


Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry
Don't say goodbye again
Don't say goodbye again
Don't make me cry, cry, cry, again
Again, again

The more I try the more you hurt me
Why 
Tell me why 
Tell me why


I can take an aspirin for a bad headache
But what pill for loneliness can I take 
I can see through you just like cellophane
But I need you baby like a star needs fame
Standing at the edge of time 'bout to lose my mind
'Cause you tried to take him away from me
I won't let it be
You just walk into my life trying to take away my only prize
But you better give credit 'cause his love is right here for me

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance

He belongs to me, just wait and see
Take him in his arms and give him love
Not too much of me
Nothing you can do or say to make him look your way
So you better give credit 'cause it's gonna come walking my way

You don't stand another chance
You don't stand another chance
 You don't stand
 You don't stand
You don't stand another chance.

How can I stop losing you 
How can I begin to say
When there s nothing left to do but walk away  Yeah

No quiero mirar ma ana!
Don't wanna see... 
Tomorrow, no no no, no no no
Don't wanna see... 


Love has brought us to a fork in the road
Giving us a choice of two ways to go
My hope has always been to stay with you
But you like to leave me so all alone, oh

Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way 
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
When our love was so strong just yesterday


A little at a time, you gained control
Ruling my heart and mind
And my very soul
But even if I knew what was to come
I'd gladly bare the pain
And love you just the same


Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
How can you say it has to be this way 
Don't wanna see tomorrow without you, girl
When our love was so strong just yesterday
Yah!


Don't wanna see tomorrow
Don't wanna see tomorrow
No quiero mirar ma ana!
Don't wanna see tomorrow, oh!

Bart 
Bart! Bart!
Bart!
I didn't do it. Nobody saw me do it. You can't prove anything
Yo! Hey, what's happening, dude 
I'm a guy with a rep for bein' rude
Terrorizin' people wherever I go
It's not intentional, just keepin' the flow
Fixin' test scores to get the best scores
Droppin' banana peels all over the floor
I'm the kid that made delinquency an art
Last name, Simpson; first name, Bart
I'm here today to introduce the next phase
The next step in the big Bart craze
I got a dance, real easy to do
I learned it with no rhythm and so can you! Uh
So move your body, if you got the notion
Front to back in a rock-like motion
Now that you got it, if you think you can
Do it to the music, that's the Bartman


Everybody if you can, do the Bartman! 
Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man! 
Move your butt to the side, yes you can, can! 
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman 
Everybody if you can, do the Bartman!
Shake your body, turn it out, if you can, man! 
Move your butt to the side, yes you can, can!
Everybody in the house, do the Bartman

Do what you wanna
And do it 
I got to convince you
You gotta stick to it


Keep on striving towards your goal
If it's right, don't let it go
Live the life you wanna live
Don't be phony, just be for real
People 
Don't be nobody 


Do what you wanna
And do it
I got to convince you
You gotta stick to it


Don't let nobody fool you around
Tryna turn your life upside down
Just be strong in your field
And when you reach the top, happy you will live
People 
Don't be nobody 
Hey, hey, hey, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah

Hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, hee
Hee, hee, oh

We could sail away our dreams to our Never Neverland
We could kiss the world and wish upon a distant star
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the answers lie deep inside your lovely eyes
I could look inside your mind and tell that you re far away
Don t say a word, just let me whisper inside your ear
I could see that you are trying hard to be my friend
All the words you wanna say is all I want to hear

And I can t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can t break these promises
But I ll give you all th  love that I can give
And things and dreams and what is r al
Like sharing truths and tales of youth and love


Did you ever stop to think just why I look inside your eyes 
 Cause this love we have is just a dream away
I could tell you re crying  cause you really love me, girl
And the answers lie deep in the words I have to say
I could say the future, hope for us has different promises
And the life we need is just a life away
I could look inside your mind and tell that you love me, girl
And the words you want to hear, is all I wanna say


And I can t give you promises
And we can wish upon a star
But I can t break these promises
But I ll give you all the love that I can give
And things and dreams and what is real
And sharing truths and tales of youth and love 
And love 
I guess, I'll always a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
A romantic fool, that's what I am
I think about you, all day long
Though it's impossible, for us to be together
Oh, it's not real, a love I can't feel
Guess, I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
I just can't wait, till I go to sleep
I'll be with you, all night long
Circumstances held me in a terrible face
It's fantasy, I just like to share these moments together
Guess, I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
And nothing comes but sleep, to a dreamer
And when you wake up the dream is gone away
Guess, I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
Guess, I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away

What about sunrise 
What about rain 
What about all the things that you said we were to gain 
What about killing fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine 

Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before 
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth and weeping shores 


Ah, oh

Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son 
What about flowering fields

Is there a time 
What about all the things that you said was yours and mine 


Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before 
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores 


Ah, ooh
Ah, ooh


What have we done to the world 
Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son 
What about flowering fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the dreams that you said was yours and mine 

What about sunrise  What about rain 
What about all the things that you said we were to gain 
What have we done to the world  Look what we've done
What about all the peace that you pledge your only son 


Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war 
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores 

Ah, ooh


Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang-bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad


All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us


Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, bite me, don't you black or white me


All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us


Tell me, what has become of my rights 
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me 
Am I a victim of police brutality, now 
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
You're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no
What about sunrise 
What about rain 
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain 
What about flowering fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine 
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before 
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
What have we done to the world 
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son 
What about flowering fields 
Is there a time 
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine 
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war 
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, these weeping shores 
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah
Hey
What about yesterday 
What about us 
What about those lions 
What about us 
What about yesterday

What about us 
What about everything 
What about us 
I can't even breathe
What about us

Deep within our skin

What about my fear 
What about us 
What about everything 
What about us 
I can hear them sigh
What about us 
What about everything 
What about us 
What about the man 
What about us 
What about everything 
What about us 
What about the man 
What about us 
What about everything

I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe

Capture me my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say

That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be

I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

Animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And I got the prey in sight
Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe
Capture me, my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstasy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the word
And you say

That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be


I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive



Now I got you on the run
And the quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times
With a little stimulation
It'll come once more
And you say

Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be, eaten alive
Uh-uh, uh-huh, oh
Oh, oh




Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat
Eat, eat, eat, eat, eat, eat
Eat, eat, eaten alive, eaten alive



I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dang rous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get  aten alive




Tie me to a tree, crawl all over me
You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say

And you s that's impossible
It's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be

No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive

None
Like an animal stalking you at night
I'm a sucker for someone
And i got the prey in sight
Hiding in a bed of leaves
In Modern Times
As you forget and let your spirit breathe
Catch me when my blood is red
Another victim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain t you find
In the modern world
Cause  one touch of you can be
Can be the end of you and me

And you say
That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I could see
Could be the taste of you and me

Chorus:
I don't wanna be eaten alive
In a world so dangerous
No more hearts i can trust, you see
I don't wanna be eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be, Eaten Alive



Now that we re on the run
And the quicker my senses
Chances are, you re the faster one
Because I know who s the evil one
In Evil Times
You beg for mercy
But it won't come once more

How come you're always such a fussy young man 
Don't want no Captain Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran
Well, don't you know that other kids are starving in Japan 
So eat it, just eat it 
Don't wanna argue, I don't wanna debate
Don't wanna hear about what kinds of foods you hate 
You won't get no dessert 'til you clean off your plate
So eat it, don't you tell me you're full


Just eat it , eat it 
Get yourself an egg and beat it
Have some more chicken, have some more pie
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
Just eat it , just eat it 
Just eat it , just eat it 

Your table manners are a cryin' shame
You're playin' with your food, this ain't some kind of game
Now if you starve to death you'll just have yourself to blame
So eat it, just eat it 
You better listen, better do what you're told 
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole 
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold
So eat it, I don't care if you're full


Just eat it , eat it 
Open up your mouth and feed it
Have some more yogurt, have some more Spam
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned
Just eat it , eat it 
Don't you make me repeat it
Have a banana, have a whole bunch
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch
Just eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it
Eat it, eat it, eat it, eat it




Eat it , eat it 
If it's getting cold, reheat it
Have a big dinner, have a light snack
If you don't like it, you can't send it back
Just eat it , eat it 
Get yourself an egg and beat it 
Have some more chicken , have some more pie 
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried
None
Welcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do, what you were told
But they robbed you, of your childhood
Took your youth, and sold it for gold


Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true 
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me

Lovely Elizabeth
You have surpassed them all
My friend Elizabeth
Learned to outlast them all
Many started, back when you did
Lost their way, and now they are gone
But look at you, a true survivor
Full of life, and carrying on


Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star, that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true 
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star


This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But through all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know, you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like, walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were, beating life's battles
Again and again

Que tratar de hacerte m a

Ah, listen to me, baby
Musical chairs, you see, my dear, ain't ever been my thing
Shuffleboard to me, you see, it just ain't the same
Well, tic-tac-toe has got to go
It truly has become a bore
Checkers games, I've lost my last
And I don't wanna lose no more


Now, you can keep on playing hide and seek
And things like blind man s bluff
But tricks are made for kids, baby
But the name of the game is love, oh


E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full 
E-ne-me-ne-mi-ne-moe, the choice is yours to pull
Do you wanna keep on playing games
Or take this heart in full 


Now I believe in lovin  hard
Don't care about games or money
I believe in being love rich
So I've never been love poor, honey
Playing the field behind my back
And to my face saying that you're true
That's the game foolish kids
Baby, not for me and you

Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
You better enjoy yourself
You better enjoy yourself


You sittin' over there, starin' into space
Awhile people are dancin', dancin' all over the place
But you shouldn't worry about things you can't control
Come on girl, while the night is young
Why don't she let, let herself go "Woo!"


Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me
Enjoy yourself, enjoy yourself
Enjoy yourself with me


Let's have some fun
Let's have a good time, you and me
Sittin' there with your mouth poked out
Just as sweet as you can be
Why don't you live, live the life you got
Come on girl, let's get it, while the music's runnin' hot, woo!

Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Euphoria, euphoria
Euphoria, euphoria


E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
That's the new word for today
E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
It is very easy to say

Say euphoria
And you'll feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart


Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still


Watch rainbows glow
Rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything's in your powers


E-U-P-H-O-R-I-A
Full of 
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn


Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart

Oh
Yeah


Do you remember the time when we fell in love 
'Cause I remember the night when you had enough of my creepin', oh
You packed up your bags and said you were leavin'
You found a new man and said we were even now
Even now
It's funny how everythin' seems to even out
Even now

I wish you could put it behind you
Wish you would put up your blinders
Wish you would stop listenin' to your friends
And come somewhere no one would find us
Wish you would just keep your focus on me
So I can give you a reminder
That I can be who I'm supposed to
I can do better, I know you remember


Every single night, we were livin' life in love
Every single time, I was doin' right, enough
To keep you around, now look at where I end up
Look where I end up


Remember the time when we fell in love 
'Cause I remember the night
I know you had enough of my creepin', oh
Baby, it was only for a season, maybe


And it ain't even really had nothin' to do with you 
It was all really me 
'Cause I was tryna see the world 
Like a dog on a leash 
And you was tryna hold me back
I ain't wanna let you go ahead of me 
I let you go and I knew I should have never let you go ahead of it

Gotta find a way somehow
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gotta find a way somehow
Even though you're gone
Even though you're gone


Things don't look as bad as they did yesterday
Every minute I get stronger
Somehow, someway
'Cause I gotta keep on living
I got the will to survive
Even though I feel so bad, so bad inside

Gotta find a way somehow
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gotta find a way somehow
Even though you're gone
Even though you're gone


All the plans I had, I've got to give them up and start anew
Makin' plans for one
Instead of making plans for two
From now on, I'll be thinkin', thinkin' 'bout myself
It'll be a long, long time
Before I love somebody else


Gotta find a way somehow
Nothing's gonna stop me now
Gotta find a way somehow
Even though you're gone


I depended on you for everything
Oh, I really trusted you
How could you do me the way you did 
Oh, you really let me down, yeah

Oh, everybody, get down on the floor 
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more 


I've had my days of standing on shaky grounds
I want my life so fancy-free
I know that I can do it
I have to let me be
And I've had enough
And I know what's right for me


I've done my time and I have paid the price
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud
Forget your worries
And let's dance and shout
All you have to do
Is state my name out loud


Oh, everybody, get down on the floor 
I love the way you shake your thing
You make me want some more 

Everybody is a star
Who would rain and chase the dust away
Everybody wants to shine
Who'll come out on a cloudy day 
'Til the sun that does you proud
When the system tries to bring you down
Never had to shine at night
You don't need darkness to do what you think is right


Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Ooh hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo
Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa
Ooh, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa, wa


Everybody is a star
I can feel it when you shine on me
Oh, I love you for who you are
Not the one you feel you need to be
Ever catch a falling star
Ain't no stopping 'til it's in the ground
Everybody is a star
One big circle going round and round
Everybody's somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody's somebody's fool 

You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you're giving them love
But remember, sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above 

It's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends 
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool 

Oh, it's beautiful to watch love begin
But, oh, so sad when it ends 
As you go through life, remember this rule
Everybody's somebody's fool NoneAlright, we can walk away
But I turned my head to see if you would stay
Baby, we can laugh today
Then I'm hoping that we throw the stones away
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hhhh

Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me waiting here 
Now you got me here, in tears
Hold me

Hold me tonight
Girl, spread your love tonight
Yeah
It's gonna be alright
Everything will be just fine
If you're loving me tonight, tell me it'll be alright
It's gonna be alright
Say it's gonna be just fine
Everything's just fine
Yeah
Everything will be just fine, alright

She wrote me a letter, it's burning in my heart
She's setting me free
Hee-Hee
She in the dark
Whispers in the dark, save me from these thoughts
Un-break my heart, don't you let it fall apart
Please stay this way, don't you run away
I've got a premonition
I used to dream
Oooh, girl. it burned just like the sun

We know the way
But I turned my head to see if you would stay
We can laugh the day
Then I'm hopin' that we throw the stones away


Baby, don't you leave me standing here
Why you leave me waiting here
Now you got me here in tears

Hold me tonight
Spread your love tonight
It's gonna be alright
Everything will be just fine
Love me tonight

It's gonna be alright

Everything's just fine
Yeah, everything will be just fine 


She wrote me a letter
That's burned into my heart
Set me free

Whispers in the dark

Un-break my heart
Don't let it fall apart


Please stay this way
Don't you run away
I gotta  this dream
I'm gonna burn just like the sun


Feels like a fire that burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around for every day to start
I haven't left you alone
There's something about you, the stare in your eyes
And everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
Oh, I wanna spend time till it ends
I want to fall with you again
Like we did , when we first met 
I want to fall with you again


Ohhhhh


We fought in a battle, and nobody won
Now we face a mountain to be overcome
You can't turn away, the past is said and done
I need us to carry on

Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
I wanna spend time till it ends
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You can't run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on

Tear me apart, break my heart
Let me in this wonderland with you
Your desire warms my heart
I loved you from the moment, yes I


She said she want to fall in love
She said she want to give it up, oh
She said she want to turn my life all around
She said she want to play the game
I love you when you say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

I want to fall, want to fall in love with you
Oh, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

Girl, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

Please, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you


Now I am here with you
The sun comes through
The moon is watching us, me and you
The sun is going down 
The rain is coming down
And the wind is blowing us and it's ooh


She said she want to fall in love 
She said she want to give it up
She said she want to turn my life all around


I want to fall, want to fall in love with you 
Oh, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

Girl, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you 

Please, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh


I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry

Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah


When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget  No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry


Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah


Ooh, farewell, farewell
Ooh, farewell, farewell
If you remember my name 
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you

Ooh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh

None
Your butt is wide, well mine is too
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you
The word is out, better treat me right
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right
My zippers bust, my buckles break
I'm too much man for you to take
The pavement cracks when I fall down
I've got more chins than Chinatown
Well, I've never used a phone booth
And I've never seen my toes
When I'm goin' to the movies
I take up seven rows


Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on

You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it

You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know

Don't you call me pudgy, portly or stout
Just now tell me once again who's fat

Yeah, yeah, yeah, mmm
Mmm


I'm lost
Is it really even my fault 
I don't think that it's supposed to be hard
If it's really meant to be
So give me a sign
Is he always gonna be mine 
Have I given it enough of my time 
You cannot blame if it don't mean nothing


Sweet, sweet fate
I had about all I can take
Am I living in the bed that I made 
Is it yours  I wonder
Sweet, sweet fate 
Oh if it's really out of my hands 
Can you forgive all of my sins  
Have mercy on me, me


Why me 
If you walked a mile using my feet
You would go a little easy on me
You'd know where I'm coming from, yeah
How come, when I'm lookin' at everyone
They get away with havin' their fun 
I'm paying these dues when they don't mean nothing
None
One, two, three, four


Seems I've got to have a change of scene
'Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it could have been
Left here all alone or so it seems
I've got to leave before I start to scream
Someone locked the door and turned the key

]
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself 
Feeling alright 
Not feeling too good myself


Boy, she really took me for one big ride
Even now I sit and I wonder why
And when I think of you I start to cry
I just can't wipe my face and I must keep trying
I've got to stop believing all your lies
'Cause there's too much to do before I die, ooh


Feeling alright

Feeling alright

Feeling alright
Feeling alright

Feeling alright

Feeling alright

Feeling alright

Not feeling too good myself
Feeling alright
I'm not feeling too good myself 
Seems I've got to have a change of scene
Cause every night I have the strangest dreams
Imprisoned by the way it should have been
Left me all alone or so it seems
Ooh, I've got to leave before I start to scream
But someone locked the door and turned the key


Feelin alright
I'm not feelin too good myself
Feelin alright
I'm not feelin too good myself

Boy she really took me for one big ride
And when I think of you, I start to cry
And I just can't wipe and I must keep dry
I've got to stop believing all your lies, yeah baby
Cause there's too much to do before I die, yeah

Feelin alright
I'm not feelin too good myself
Feelin alright
I'm not feelin too good myself

Hey, hey, hey
The words I want to say to you are
Stored away in dreams
Never to be revealed, safe from
What seems
No place for hate, no place for hurt
But a place for caresses
Beauty in what I see and feel
No tears for my baby
No sadness, no fear
Just touch me, you
Fair love of my dreams
Shadows of moonlight
Shine on your hair
Playing a tune of ecstasy
In my soul
Where have you been when
I was yearning for love, and a kiss
Did you miss the fall of stardust
That led to my heart, or were you
Teasing me with eyes so b autiful
So beautiful, and a kiss, so sweet
So sweet
I will let you lift the virginal v il from
My face
My baby, I love you
You got it on the side
A little one-night thing
I thought it over and this time I will forgive you
Well I'm not letting go
But don't forget I know
You made your bed and she was in it, no no no


What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 
What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 
What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 
What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 

Well I'm not blaming you
But she's still hanging around
And she's so crazy, tell ya now I just don't trust her
She thinks she's right on time
But I think she crossed the line
And I'm ready for the ride, I'm ready if it's fighting time


What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 
What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 
What's she gonna look like with a chimney on her 1 - 	Can you feel it 
	Can you feel it 
	Can you feel it 
	
	It's makin' me hot, it's makin' me hot
	It's makin' me hot, yo, yo

	Can you feel it 
	Can you feel it 
	Can you feel it 
	
	It's makin' me hot, it's makin' me hot
	It's makin' me hot, yo, yo


Uh uh uh
Wanna test my waters  Step in
Hot, no question, what  Interested 
Chick blessed in drop
No less than sick flows
Tell me who the best in ill pitch, ill bitch, hit it
Cats know I deliver blows, kill hits
Kill the light switch, I'm barkin' in my CB
Tight chick with charts in mind
Hearts in my actress
Better address me with status
Ms. and Misses, ya'll who's and what's
Came in viscious
Everything I touch, ya'll wanna get it
Cats wanna hit it, hide when I spit it
What ya'll do  Did it. Wanna get it 
Wanna get rich, I'mma show you money
Now you want a hot chick, gotta throw your money
Why you wanna hate me, I don't know you money
Ya'll cats got late fee's, I don't owe you money
Ya'll quick to wild out and just blow your money
Should it stash high, burnin' flashlight
Girls need to know if you're stuck for money
Cats get sheisty, I might duck for money
Let 'em know, you ain't gettin' buck for money
And tall slick, I bank ten and front for money, what

One, two, three, jam


Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about 
I have to find my peace 'cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities 
I told my brother there'd be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last, go with it, go with it

Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me to
Jam
It ain't
It ain't too much stuff
It ain't too much
It ain't too much for me


Jam, jam, here comes the man
Hot damn, the big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, 'cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle
Bum rushed the doors, threes and fours in a bundle
Execute the plan, first I cooled it like a fan
Got with Janet, then with Guy, now with Michael
'Cause it ain't too hard to jam


Ow!

I got to find me a girl
I got to find me a girl, oh


Somebody who
Can make all my dreams come true
Somebody soft and warm
I know just what I want


I've been searching everywhere
Can't seem to find her anywhere
Could it be you 
Could it be you 
Could it be you 

I got to find me a girl
I got to find me a girl, oh


Somebody true
To make all my lonely nights
A thing of the past
Someone to make everything all right


Got to find me a girl
Find me a girl
Got to find me a girl
Oh, baby


Somebody who 
Can make all my dreams come true
Somebody soft and warm
I know exactly what I want


Been searching everywhere
I can't find her anywhere
Could it be you 
Could it be you 
Could it be you 

Our love's in motion
Give me a notion cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
I love in season
Give me a reason cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye


And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it


Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Our love's in motion
Give me a notion cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye
I love in season
Give me a reason cause
You know I'll never part
Our love goodbye


And together we'll fly
I'll give you my heart
No place too far for us
We don't need it


Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today

Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Baby don't make me
Fly away
Gonna stay
Love today
Lyrics from snippet

Ooh-ooh
Don't let foolish pride get in the way of a good love

Like yours and mine


How could you let me walk outside your door
When there's so much you wanted to say 
How could you just pretend you could ignore
All the feelings that true love has made, ooh baby
 I was right there by your side
Through good and bad, ooh baby
 Let me know the reason why
You're treating me so bad


Don't let foolish pride get in the way of a good love
Like yours and mine
Don't let foolish pride make you say things
That you don't mean


Ooh, my baby, my sweet baby
I'm the one you held so dear
Now that the weather here is changing
You don't even want me near
You know in the beginning, everything was rosy
Everything was a-okay
Now you're telling me to go
I guess I'll be on my way


 I was right there by your side
Through good and bad, ooh baby
 Let me know the reason why
You're treating me so bad

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well


And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there


And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time


Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say


And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Sun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, the songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'll do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you would know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well


And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time


Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
Whats good love  I da, really seen it
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there


And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time

Sun comes up on this new morning

Baby, you gotta know that's for all time







There you are, standing there
Reaching out for me
Something warm in your eyes
Has touched my heart
And all the love I never knew
I found in you


Suddenly, my world, my life
Was standing still
And you touched my hand
I knew that we had laid a plan
For everlasting love
I've been forever dreaming of


At last, at last, my forever came today
When you walked into my life
Made my lonely life a paradise
It came today, forever came today

Oh baby, came, came today, forever came today


Love to hear your music, mmm, love to hear your song
I've gotta hear your music
Hear your sweet song
Hear your music, I've gotta hear your song
Hear your music, I've gotta hear your song
Hey, I don't wanna lose it
Baby, I don't wanna lose it


Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever


Make it last forever
I believe we can make it last forever
Oh, I believe, baby, we can make it last forever
Oh, I believe we can make it last forever
I believe we can make it last forever
Don't you believe that we can make it last forever
Oh, why won't you believe we can make it last forever


Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever, forever, forever
Forever, forever,  ever,  ever,  ever
SnippetReggae
You're the one that I adore, you
Give me one and don t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
Well, obviously, I do
That's why I want to be

Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine


You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I start tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing, she don't past the way I do
Because I want to be


Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
Babe, alright
Ahh, ahh
Oh yeah
With a corncob pipe and a button nose
And two eyes made out of coal
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale they say
He was made of snow but the children
Know how he came to life one day
There must have been some magic in that
Old silk hat they found
For when they placed it on his head
He began to dance around
O
Frosty the snowman
Was alive as he could be
And the children say he could laugh
And play just the same as you and me
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Look at Frosty go
Thumpetty thump thump
Thumpety thump thump
Over the hills of snow

Frosty the snowman knew
The sun was hot that day
So he said
"Let's run and
We'll have some fun
Now before I melt away
" Down to the village
With a broomstick in his hand
Running here and there all
Around the square saying
Catch me if you can
He led them down the streets of town
Right to the traffic cop
And he only paused a moment when
He heard him holler "Stop!"
For Frosty the snow man
Had to hurry on his way
But he waved goodbye saying
"Don't you cry
I'll be back again some day

Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
Fruit of life
Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why
Fruit of life


Something in your eyes
Makes the waters ripple
And the leaves fall from the trees
It happens every time
Love so warm and gentle
Sailing smooth across the sea


Hold fast to this feeling
Never take the chance and let love go 
Here for you and willing
I wanna know your way
Let's take it nice and slow


Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why

Fruit of life
Taste the fruit of life
Don't stop yourself to wonder why

Fruit of life

Just call my name
Just call my name
Just call my name
Whenever you need me


You talking outside of your neck
I thought that we were good friends

What could I expect
All good things
Must come to an end
You had me so na ve
You had me so deceived
You had me in The Garden
Listening to your lies
Like Adam and Eve
This relationship so bad
Pack all your clothes
Get up and leave
Yeah
My body is a temple
I can't give you what you need
If you thinking bout playing those games
Well
I got some tricks up my sleeve
You don't care about my feelings
You just do as you please
I prayed for a better husband
Someone that cherish his kids
You drop them off at daycare
Never pick 'em up
Look what you did
You don't see
- my worth
Sent down from heaven
Brought evil on Earth

My new husband is Christ
I see how the devil works
I had to be down to Earth
I wasn't real with myself
Running after false security
God provided the help
I used to want riches
Well
Knowledge is wealth
No more bitterness
Put that in the trash
Not on the shelf
I got angels on my back
I got angels on their toes
From the concrete
I have rose
From the streets paved with gold
You know how the story goes
You know how the story goes
I ain't talking "Weston Road"
Time to put on wedding clothes

You're not my girl, not my wife
Got a couple tips from Mike
I'm moon-walkin' out tonight
I close my eyes, you ought of sight

And she wanna call me conceited 
Cause I'm a smooth criminal, I told her to beat it
When a little love was all I needed
You talkin'  I call it how I see it

And now I mean it, I'm out for good
Like a lot of you when I'm movin' out the hood
But if I told you to take me back, you would
Too late, like me, Pete, Pac, you should

Had you in the cars for the metro
With a couple superstars from the get-tuh
Now you feelin' so sorry you let go
Of the T-E-M-P-A-Mental

 x 2
What you gonna do 
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I'm the Blue Gangsta
What you gonna do 
You ain't no friend of mine
I can never fall in love
The Blue Gangsta


You ain't a friend, a friend you never be
Obviously you never been with a real OG
From the H-I-T, rollin' B-I-G
Pass it through, V-I-P, it's the righteous G

You going, "Spread some love," like the gold rush
It was the things you did that you used to mean so much
Whatever you touch, the way you used to blush
Not me you brush, I don't believe in such

Nonsense, lovers don't promote violence
Non-cents, just like your dollars -- no sense
No good, I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this  You wanna suck my existence

But still, I believe in you and me
Quite frankly, that's how it's supposed to be
The kind of love like you endin' your poverty
So I keep me scoped like a Kennedy
Yeah!

I said maybe tonight
We will get it right
We will get around 
So get around me 
Get around them 
Get around the world today
And show me what you got
Cause you ain't gonna give upNone
Miss Lady Girl
Is putting her love on the shelf
Cause she don't want
To be hurt by nobody else
She's taken her heart
And put it away under lock and key
But it's high time
Miss Lady Girl sets her heart free and gives her love to me, yeah


But some think that diamond rings, fancy cars
Will make a big impression, yeah, ha! Dah
But I know that all she needs is my tender
Love and affection
Cause she still says


That no one's gonna get it 
No one's gonna get it, oh no
But someone's gotta get it
And I feel that I will be the one who will 
No one's gonna get it   
No one's gonna get it, oh no 
But someone's gotta get it 
And I know that I will be the one who will 
Gonna get it, her love
Gonna get it, her kisses
Gonna get it, her heart
Gonna get it, get it

You better get it together
Or leave it alone
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Get up, get up, get up


Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin', doin'
Get up off your high horse, girl
Think what you're doin' doin'

I'm spinnin' around
On your merry-go-round
You got me dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy, dizzy


Get it together
Or leave it alone 
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
Now, now baby
Get it together
Or leave it alone 
If you don't want my lovin'
I'll be gone
None

I'll never see you again
This game  
I was the fool you could take
Another heart you could break
So let me go on my way

Pre-chorus
Sent out a message to you
You know I ll never stop trying, baby

See, you got a lesson to learn
You only get what you earn

I've got this game 
And I have to go my way alone, baby


Just get your weight off of me
Why don't you just let me be  
You keep on hating on me   
You just don't have what it takes
So let me go on my way
No more of being a prey

It's been a long time
Please, keep me company
While I'm waiting at you
All day for you, yeah
Got the way, right way
Got my backpack
And I'm waiting at you
All day for you


And now there's daylight sun

There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see

Because now it's haunting me

There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair

And a coughing and a yawning
Where a restless soul is going

There were times when I just wanted
To get the passion started
But I had to wait 'til you were mine
Every time we got together
I could tell that you were better
Than all the other girls in my life
Now that you're with me
I can see clearly, no doubt
It's worth all my time

Everytime that you come around
And we touch, touch
I can't get enough

You're giving me a rush, rush
Everytime that you come around
And when we touch, touch
I can't get enough

Tell me all your secrets
I won't tell a soul
I'll keep it on the low

Just tell me what you do
That makes me want to lose control

We got a special thing
Can't let nobody come between

I know you're feeling
Hope you're feeling the same way
That I feel


They'll never understand the way I feel
Wonder why we're so affectionate
Why, why

Or where we are
Baby, it feels like we're alone

Goin' back to Alabama
Now that I've learned a thing or two
Life for me had been so easy
But I've got some livin' yet to do


'Cause a man who walks by the side of the road
Can turn himself around
He can pick himself up
And dust himself off
And start all over again, my friend


Some days I didn't wanna wake up in the mornin'
My family and friends were all down on me
I tried to tell 'em where I was goin'
But they never saw the man I saw in me
Some folks call me a dreamer
Other folks laughed and called me a fool
All I ever wanted to be was a winner
'Cause I know a winner can never lose


'Cause a man who walks by the side of the road
Can turn himself around
He can pick himself up
And dust himself off
And start all over again
Yes, a man who walks by the side of the road
Can turn himself around
He can pick himself up
And dust himself off
And start all over again, my friend

Leaving this old town to confusion
Maybe love will be the solution

Du nennst es Karriere, f r mich war es ein Jahr in 'nem Rapgame
Ich k nnt allein Sachen von mir erz hl'n, die hat dein ganzer R cken nicht ma' erlebt
Sie woll'n mich kleinreden und in Ketten legen
Schei  drauf, ob ich entertaine
Ein Kreislauf von klein auf , ich zahl' den Preis, bin die Legende ewig, geb' 
Kickdown, fick' Frau'n, Freiheit, Blockkids 
Sitz' im Cockpit, trotzdem Kopfficks 
Fick nicht mein'n Kopf, es reicht 
Bin rich, doch im Herzen gleich 
Kriege nachts mein'n Kopf nicht frei
Habe Frust in mir, wallah, nur Gott wei

She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don t mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round " 
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round 
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of bein' the one 
Who will dance on the floor in the round
I m Kermit, Kermit The Frog
Yeah

People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breakin' young girls' hearts" 
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" 
Hey-ay
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son


Alright I can't fuckin' do this, man
I m, God

Gordon, that's really pretty
Thank you
We should try singing those lyrics we wrote in New York
Which song 
"Half of You"
Oh yeah, let's try that
Be kinda dope, right 
And we gon' get Mimi and Maxee to help us on some background
Y'all gon' do that 
Y'all better sing
Sing, brother
Sing

Now and then
I wonder where you are and where you've been
We were friends
But deep inside my heart, I always knew
I only needed one not two
I wish that I could say the same for you
Every day
I kept you oh so dear and close to my heart
I was yours
I thought that you were mine
Right from the start
We made a vow to be as one
But you played your games
Put our love to shame
And now the magic's gone


I never wanted half of you
Sharing you will just not do
Gotta be, one on one, or it won't be done
You said you wanted all of me
Why couldn't it be two not three 
It's too late
I won't take half of you

Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya


Children gather 'round now
Clap your hands and sing
That old sun is shining down
Soon the bells are gonna ring
Yes they will now
Can't you see that ray of hope
Somebody finally saw the light
They're gonna send our brothers home
It's gonna be alright, yeah


Hallelujah day
Sing hallelujah
Love is on its way
It's coming to ya
Hallelujah day

Men and kings have come to

So close to me
The Son of God
Now all can see

A Child is born to save us now, Jesus

Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was till now

And I just don't know why I stay
Baby, I cannot escape
You're so dangerous
Scandalous
Why you won't let me leave



Heartbreak Hotel
Heartbreak!
Tell me why you gotta go breakin' my heart
Heartbreak Hotel



Said baby, don't understand these games you wanna play with me
But I know you're dangerous
And I know you're scandalous
For some funny reason I can t leave
Feel it up under my skin
Feelin  it deeper within

Deceitful eyes, she's got those come get me thighs
She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe  that I can t tell her no


That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker

She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker


I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
And start being without you
But I ll find a way to go and start doing without you
And stop talking about you
And what will she say 
She will say I was the man that got away

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I'd tell them no

Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's a chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait


Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no


Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone

I don't want nobody else to hold you

That's a chance I'll take

Heaven knows I love you, girl
I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more and more


People always stare at us when we're together
'Cause we laugh and joke and always have a ball
We're friends and that makes us so much better
We respect each other too
I was lucky the day that I found you
Heaven knows I love you, girl
I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more and more


I've found a little place for us to go and be alone
Let's fix it up the way we want and call it home sweet home
Our love is priceless, it's so, so rare
We believe in the same things too
I was lucky the day that I found you

Heaven knows I love you, girl
I've never felt this way before
Each day I love you more and more and more


Precious is a love that's based on truth
No words could ever describe the way I feel about you
You know, when two hearts beat as one
When two minds think as one
They can overcome any obstacle
And always stay together

Heaven knows I love you, girl
Heaven knows I love you, girl
Heaven knows I love you, girl

Heaven knows I love you, girl


Heaven knows I love you, girl

A lonely mother gazing out of the window
Staring at a son that she just can't touch
If at any time he's in a jam, she'll be by his side
But he doesn't realize he hurts her so much
But all the praying just ain't helping at all
Cause he can't seem to keep his self out of trouble
So he goes out and he makes his money the best way he knows how
Another body laying cold in the gutter
Listen to me

Don't go chasing hedgehogs
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all
But I think you're moving too fast


Little precious has a natural obsession for temptation
But he just can't see
She gives him loving that his body can't handle
But all he can say is, "Baby it's good to me"
One day he goes and takes a glimpse in the mirror
But he doesn't recognize his own face
His health is fading and he doesn't know why
Three letters took him to his final resting place
Y'all, don't hear me

]
Don't go chasing hedgehogs
Please stick to the rivers and the lakes that you're used to
I know that you're gonna have it your way or nothing at all

But I think you're moving too fast

She's headed for the big time, that means

Lipstick in hand
Tahitian tan
In her painted-on jeans

To one that fits the movie screen
She's headed for the big time that means


She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood
She's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood

To pursue her movie star dreams
She's giving hot tricks to men
Just to get in
She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time that means

Lipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans
She dreams of fame, she changed her name

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight

It was there on my grandma s farm
Where the grapes grew high on the vine
Yeah, that s where we first met little girl

But you ain t gonna amount to nothing
Cause you ain t gonna work for nothing
Without you I ain t good for nothing, honey chile
Oh honey chile, you re sure about to drive me wild

And I love you so, can t let go now honey chile
Oh, sugar chile, I d walk me a country mile
Just to be with you if that were true but honey chile
You don t act like a lady
Cause you ve been courting Davie
Its reputation shady oh honey chile
Hey you even went out with Callie
That night across the alley
Oh, I ve been keeping tally honey chile

You re like grapes upon the vine
That went in Granny s wine
Cause like that home-made wine so sweet
You re sure enough driving me out of my mind now

Your friends with every playboy
Using me for a play toy
You ruined my pride and joy now honey chile

Oh honey chile, sure about to drive me wild
And I love you so, can t let go now honey chile
Oh, sugar chile, I d walk me a country mile
Just to be with you if that were true of honey chile

Why don t you put on your shoes little girl
Then I can kiss you
Oh listen here now

One day I m gonna get stronger
And I won t need you no longer
This feeling will be gone oh honey chile

Baby, you got honey love
Sweeter than candy, you got honey love
I've got to have it, that honey love
Sweeter than candy, that got honey love

]
I keep on yearning all in my sleep
You've got me burning

I can't believe love can be so neat
Oh and your sweet love


You're takin' to me good
Just like you know you should
You get me on my knees
Please, baby, please
She looks so great, everytime I see her face
She put me in a state, ooh! 


Top coat. Top hat
I don't worry, cause my wallet's fat
Black shades. White glove
Lookin' sharp. Lookin' for love
They come a-runnin' just as fast as they can
Cause every girl's crazy 'bout a sharp-dressed man, hey!
Whoo! Ah ha!


Oh, what's love, got to do, got to do with it 
What's love but a second-hand emotion 
What's love got to do, got to do with it 
Who needs a heart, when a heart can be broken 


M-E-T-H-O-D-O-F-L-O-V-E
It's the method of modern love


Owner of a lonely heart
Owner of a lonely heart
Much better than the
Owner of a broken heart
Owner of a lonely heart

Yea. yea yea yea yea yea yea


We're not gonna take it. No!
We ain't gonna take it
We're not gonna take it, any more

 Stone shaker is looking fine
She is a heart-breaker every time
She never seems to realize
That someday she will be crying too 
 A sharpshooter that is moving fast
A slight cruiser loaded with gas
Slowing down to make a pass
You think it is going to hit
So why not take a chance 


Because this is Hot Street 
Just feel the night beat, yeah 
'Cause this is Hot Street, yeah 
Because the fantasy will never stop
On Hot Street 


 A streetwalker when there is time to spare
She got that big spenders holding their share
A heart of gold, but no one cares 
Within their eyes
Some young lovers are laughing loud
And there are some old suckers trying to get down
The evening spins around and round 
Yes, people of the night smoking through the dark

Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime

Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street

You laughed at me, you made me cry
You made a joke, then wonder why
I am a loser, I am a loser
I say hello, you say good-bye
I reach to you, you don't even try
I am a loser, I am a loser


If losin' you makes me happy
Then why does it makes me cry
Losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die 

I'm born to lose, you know it's true
And here I stand , I'm losin' you
I am a loser, I am a loser
You are the one to let me know
You needed me, now I have to go
I am a loser , I am a loser


If losin' you makes you happy
Then why does it makes me cry 
If losin' you makes you a winner
Then how did our love ever die  Ever die 


I am a fool, you know it's true
I believed in you , now you don't even try
I am a loser , I am a loser 
What foolish kind of guy am I 
You break my heart, I wonder why
I am a loser , I am a loser 


I am a loser , I am a loser 
I am a loser , I am a loser 
I am a loser, I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser , I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser 
I am a loser Part I


The eyes of love will watch you
As you go from day to day
The hands of love will catch you
When you fall along the way
My arms will hold and be with you
Your whole life through


'Cause I am love
And I'm in love with you

I find myself in wonder
Of why I've been misused
When love brings understanding
How can it be confused

Hate is drivin' me away


'Cause I am love
And I'd love to stay


Come back lover, come back
This is where you belong
Come back lover, come back
This is where you belong
Come back lover, come back
This is where you belong
Come back lover, come back
This is where you belong
Come back lover, come back
This is where you belong
Come on back, oh yeah
Please, this is where you belong
None
If you want it, you got it
I can only give you love
I can only give you love


Oh, Jimmy had a knack for talent
From being a baseball star
It makes you proud to work past it
'Cause it breaks all the other girls heart
Well, Billy had long black curly hair
And captain of the football team
While guys like me stood on the side
And watched the young girls scream


Oh girl, I can only give you love
I've made no claim to fame, you won't know my name
Oh baby, I can only give you love
Girl, if it's love that you need
Come along here with me


If you want it, you got it
I can only give you love
I can only give you love
If it's love that you need
I got what you need
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Come and get it
Woo!
You know, it s not easy to find the words to say
But love, huh, love only comes once
And for sure I know I ve been hit this time
And now I just can t get enough of you

I can t get enough of you 
I can t get enough of you 
I can t get enough of you 
Can t get enough, Can t get enough, Can t get enough
Can t get enough of you

The way you love me,  the things you do for me
How anyone can t be satisfied with just a small part of you
So I m gonna tell the world, I m gonna let them know how I feel
Nothing can turn my head, nothing you say or will ever do

I can t get enough, I can t get enough. I can t get enough of you
Can t get enough  

I m really strung out when it comes to loving you 
When we are together there s no love lost when I m with you
So I m gonna tell the world, I m gonna let them know how I feel
Nothing can turn my head, nothing you say or will ever do

I can t get enough, I can t get enough. I can t get enough of you 
I can t get enough of you.  I can t get enough, I can t get enough 
Lyrics from snippets

...yourself, to me


My heart keeps pumpin' so so so
My stomach keeps pumpin' so so so
I wanna go on and get you girl
I see your face everywhere i go


I can't get you off my mind girl 
I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind girl 
I can't get you off my mind


My brother said "Oh, you make me sick"
Get to work all night
I kept flipping and flopping like a fish
Turning all the night
I must say I have a temperature
A hundred degrees


Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't help but see you
Running often through my mind
Helpless like a baby
Sensual disguise
I can't help but love you
It's getting better all the time


I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no


Love to run my fingers
Softly while you sigh
Love came and possessed you
Bringing sparkles to your eyes
Like a trip to heaven
Heaven is the prize
And I'm so glad I found you, yeah
You're an angel in disguise

Looking in my mirror
Took me by surprise
I can't see, I want you
You're running often through my mind
Life is just a penny
Sensual disguise
Heaven is the prize
I'm so glad I found you
You're an angel in disguise


I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it even if I could
I can't help it if I wanted to
I wouldn't help it, no


A doo doo da


Looking in my mirror
Show that lovely eye
But I'm, so glad I found you, yeah yeah
You're running often through my mind
Da da just a da da, mmm
Show that lovely eyes
And I'm, I'm so glad I found you
You're an angel in disguise

My life has taken me beyond the planets and the stars
And you're the only one that could take me this far
I'll be forever searching for your love


I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day
You're the one that makes me strong
I can't make it another day
You're the fire that keeps me warm
I can't make it another day
How will I get through this storm 
I can't live another day without your love




At night  I pray before I sleep in hope of finding you 
I've opened up my heart, I want you to come through
I close my eyes, I'm searching for your love


I walked away but I was wrong
I can't make it another day

Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah 
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah


The love we're standing on is shaky ground
There ain't no way on earth to hold you down
And every road I take to you is still losing, oh yeah, ha
I'm gonna find a boat to row away
Where I won't be reaching for you night and day
Where there's no windows, ain't no doors
To let your love in, oh I, I


I can't quit your love 
No matter how hard I try to
I can't quit your love 
I keep running back to you
You know I can't quit your love, oh yeah!
Doo-doo-doo-doo-wah


You snap your fingers and I feel on fire
Like silly spinning wheels of desire
You have to be a bird with wings to get me higher

The mind that makes for me has fool's control, ho
The weakness of my judgement rules my soul
You know you've got each nerve me down to the wire, oh!

Sometimes I wonder
What I would do without you in my life
At night I wake up and all I see is your face
I know we have problems
But I still can't walk away
And all I want you to do is tell me why
'Cause I can't live without you
Tell me why


Look at us, baby
Up all night
Tearing the love apart
Aren't we the same two
People who lived through years in the dark
Ooh, every time I try to walk away
Something makes me turn around and stay


And I can't tell you why
No baby, I can't tell you why
I can't tell you why
Oh no
No baby

Why do I say what I say  Yeah
If I don't need you this much, ooh
Why do I ache for your touch  Yeah


With you it seems
I can reach the stars
With reckless hopes and dreams
But you it seems
Still don't believe
How valuble you are
I'm really loving you
Not pretending to


If I don't love you this strong
Why do I beg to belong  Yeah
How can you doubt that I care, ooh
When I'm with you everywhere  Yeah

Who's the one that loves you
The special one who needs you
You made the odds a million to me
No one else can love you
Nobody else can need you
No more than the one whose heart you won't believe


So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love 
That you're my love, baby 
I'll do it , yes, I'd do it
To show I love you


In your eyes, I see no faith
There's an absence of trust in your embrace
But why would I pretend to give
Just to take from the person for whom I live


I told you that I love you
Especially I need you
You're one love in a million was made from the stars
And maybe you'd believe me
Then maybe you would need me
But maybe may not ever convince your stubborn heart
You need love, like millions do
Someone who's special, who cares for you
I need you, like you need love
But you think my heart is just out for fun


You made the odds a million to me

No more than the one whose heart you won't believe

So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love 
That you're my love, baby 
I'll do it, yes I'd do it 
To show I love you
In your eyes I see no faith
There's an absence of trust
In your embrace

But why would I pretend to give
Just to take from the person
For whom I live


You're one love in a million was made from the stars

But maybe may not ever convince your stubborn heart

So if I have to move a mountain
Simply to prove that you're my love 
You're my love, baby 
I'd do it and I'll do it, yes I'll do it for you

And if I have to stop a river
To make you believe that I'm the one 
That special one you need 
I'd do it, yes I'd do it 

 Here I am my love
 With tears in my eyes
 Hoping  Praying  You'll realize
That there are 

If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see


If'n I was God
I'd fix it so, without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's goin' on inside
Of everyone else like me

Nobody hurts, nobody else
Oh no, I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thankin' me


If'n I were God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realise
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone
And God, that ain't half what I would do
If'n I were You-oo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-hoooo

Oh yeah!
If'n I were God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand
Oh yeah-eah!None
Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl
Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl


Mama, life for me now
Is a new sensation
Just like you said it would be
With the right situation
Now love has a meaning
And I have a goal
This feeling inside me now
Makes yesterday a hundred years old
Now I understand 
What it is to be a man, baby 
The way you explained it to me that day
You said only the right girl can make you feel this way


Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl, yeah, yeah
Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl


She said, "Son, all that messin' around
There's a good girl who's out there to be found"

Mama, oh Mama
I found that girl
Mama, oh Mama
I found that girl


Mama, life for me now

Just like you said it would be
With the right situation
Now love has a meaning
I have a goal
This feeling inside me now
Makes yesterday a hundred years old
Now I understand 
What it is to be a man 
The way you explained it to me that day
You said only the right girl
Can make me feel this way

Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl
Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl


Mama, she's that beautiful dream
That I dream each night
She's that bird of love
On whose wings I'm in flight
She's those words left
When there's no more to say
She's my sunshine
At the end of a perfect day

]
All this lets me find 
A reason to be alive 
That day when you set me upon your knee
You said only the right girl
Could be all these things


Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl
Mama, oh Mama, I found that girl


Oh oh oh, oh oh oh, ooh ooh ooh
Say, brother Jermaine
Yeah, Jackie
Have you found that girl yet 
Yeah
Show her to me
She's right over there
Where 
See her  She's right over there
Where 
The one over there in yellow dress
You see the one in the red dress over here 
No, I didn't see her
Over here in the red dress
Oh, yeah
She's foxy, foxy, foxy
Why don't you just sing to her, Jermaine 
Won't you take me with you
Won't you take me with you, girl
I know you're not there alone now
And I wanna be your man
That's why I gotta say
When at first I took you in
We had a nice association
Your love was sweet as honey then
Even bees will vouch for that

But now you found I m not your type
It s a different situation
The love you give is cold as ice
Even snowmen feel the draft

Baby, why should we carry it on 
If you really think you must, girl
I m tellin  you that you re wrong
If my love don t get your heart then I don t belong
Oh darling 
Don t do me no favors 
Don t feel obligated 
Don t you do enough baby 

If the shoe don t fit baby
 then don t force it on yourself, yeah
If the shoe don t fit honey
Don t force it on yourself

When I ve got you on my arm
You act like I m a burden
You let me know I m not much on
By the way you stay reserved

You don t like the love I give
It s fortune that s for certain
You make you seem the less you give
Is more than I deserve

Na, na, na baby
If you re not satisfied
Don t feel you have to take me girl
I may read from the line
If you don t want my love then don t waste my time

Lookin' over my photographs
I saw a picture of you an' me
Lovin' made deep
I had to write you just to tell you that
And to find out, if you really now missin' me, 'cause


If you don't love me

If you don't love me

If you don't need me
Just like I need you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do girl 
'Cause I'm in love with you


I told the doctor that I'm broken-hearted
And my temperature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you write me back and save me girl 
Tell me what I wanna hear, like you're missin' me, but


If you don't love me

If you don't need me

If you don't want me
The way I want you

If you don't love me

Lookin' over my photographs

Just like I need you
If you don't love me
If you don't love me

And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
And if you don't love me
If you don't love me
What will I do girl 
'Cause I'm in love with you


I told the doctor that I'm broken-hearted
And my temp rature has risen to a hundred and three
Why don't you writ  me back and save me girl 
Tell me what I wanna hear, like you're missin' me, but


If you don't love me

Now, if I give you me , this is how it's got to be 
First of all, I won't take you cheatin' on me 
Tell me, who can I trust if I can't trust in you 
And I refuse to let you play me for a fool 


You said that we could possibly spend eternity

See, that's what you told me, that's what you said
But if you want me, you have to be fulfilling all my dreams

If you really want me, baby

I don't wanna rain on this parade
But I'm starting to question the love that was made
I'm not looking for just an affair
Want a love that is based on truth, not just dare


You will not hurt my pride
If right now you decide
That you are not ready to settle down
But if you want my heart
Then it's time that you start

Jermaine: A man can t do no more than a woman ll let him

As if someone else controls your very soul
I've fooled myself long as I can
And I can feel the presence of another man


Girl, when you speak my name, it's just not the same
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
It's in the air

Ooh, baby, I'm losing you

When I look into your eyes
A reflection of a face I see
I'm hurt, downhearted and worried, girl
'Cause that face doesn't belong to me


It's all over your face
Someone's taken my place
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you
It's hard to hide, emptiness you feel inside
Ooh, little girl, I'm losing you

I can tell when we kiss, from the tenderness I've missed
Ah, baby, I'm losing you
I can feel it in my bones, any day you've been gone
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
Ah, baby, what happened to the love we shared 
Ooh, baby, I'm losing you
I don't wanna lose you, girl; no baby...
Peace of mind
Them girls gon  always
Want a piece of mine 
On the week-ends
She flies to Paris
Matter what s the season
She brings the season, oh
Take her to the store
Paint on floors
These are cold
Said I don t listen
I, do the most
She said she want me to cuff her
It made me cough
I still cannot fold fold
Man can t propose
Think  bout the team
I got reasons to go
Got me feeling
Some feelings I never owned
Oh, you changed me girl
Yeah, you changed my world girl
Got this feeling
Like I m being disowned
Girl, don t leave
I want you here forever
It s just you in my brain
Let s stay together
Let s make love in the rain
Babe, I know you still taste me

I've been thinking 'bout you, for quite a while
You're on my mind every day and every night
My every thought is you
The things you do
Seem so satisfying to me
I must confess it, girl


Ooh and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh and I like it
Girl, you're blowin' my mind with the things you say to me


I like the way you comb your hair
I like those stylish clothes you wear
It's just the little things you do
That show how much you really care
Like when I'm all alone with you
You know exactly what to do
You put that fire inside of me
And make it more than just a dream, yeah


Ooh and I like it
You send chills up my spine every time I take one look at you
Ooh and I like it
Ooh and I like it

Okay, this is the tempo

"I was alone in the dark when I met you..."
Drums

Like that, you know 


I was alone in the dark when I met you 
You took my hand and you told me you loved me



I was alone, there was no love in my life

I was afraid of life and you came in time

You took my hand and we kissed in the moonlight




I like the way how you're holding me

I like the way how you're loving me

I like the way how you're touching me

I like the way how you're kissing me

You'll see

Just call my name and I'll be there


And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength
I'll keep holding on

Yes I will, yes I will


Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, girl, is all I'm after
Whenever you need me
I'll be there 
I'll be there to protect you, 
With an unselfish love that respects you
Just call my name
And I'll be there 

If I had my way, girl
I'd never leave you for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want 'em to
So, while I'm away, now
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you


Let this love lift you up
When you're feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there
Ooh


Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you


Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart
Ooh, just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Oh
Here we are
Talkin' bout forever
Both know damn well
It's not easy together

We've both felt love
We've both felt pain
I'll take the sunshine
Over the rain

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darlin', I'll try
So I'm not scared
It's worth a chance to me
Take my hand
Let's face eternity

Well I can't tell you
That I'll never change
But I can swear
That in every way

And I'll try
To love only you
And I'll try
My best to be true
Oh darlin', I'll try

I'm not perfect
Just another man
But I will give you
All that I am

And I'll try
To love only you

My best to be true

Can you feel it  Can you feel it  Can you feel it 


All the colors of the world should be
Loving each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother
And tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who's hating his brother when hate won't do, hoo
'Cause we're all the same
Yes, the blood inside of me is inside of you
Now, tell me


Can you feel it  
Can you feel it  Can you feel it  

Can you feel it 

Can you feel it  Can you feel it  

There we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end


She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I m singin' to keep from feelin' blue

All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa 
Tschada dada dada naa 
Come on set me free



There I am so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can t reveal, I m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool


They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I b'n singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me what should I do


All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa 
Tschada dada dada naa 
Come on set me free


Oh, my sweet darlin', I still love you
So I'm making up with you
Tears in our eyes, testify
Breaking up is hard to do

]

The way you kiss me and love me 
Make me come runnin' to your door

The way you let me in and hug me


]
And I'm so happy I gave my love back to you 
I'm so happy you saved your love for me


]
Ooh, all of the heartaches  we go through
Would be a blessing in disguise
Your patience  is a virtue
Now can dry each other's eyes

]

Come on and kiss me and love me 
Now that our hearts feel happiness
Because I need you 
And you need me

NoneOoh-hoo, I m your sunny one 
Now let me tell you how much good for me you ve done
Cause when I m feeling low I m still your number one 
I knew you d slip some rain but with you here
There s no rain at all, oh

Oooh-hoo, I m your sunny one 
Looking good I m feelin I m your certain all holds fun
To see you I'll walk around the whole to Michigan
Do anything to be with you, your sunshine makes my world seem new

I m your sunny one 
We ll have fun
Sunny one 
Oooh-hoo

Ooh-hoo, I m your sunny one 
You make my life so sweet that I m your honey one

My cloudy days are really gone, the sunshine s here so keep on shining

Come on 
Oooh-hoo

I m your sunny one 
Now only your sweet loving I will never shun
I m trying to tell you the way that I am your sunny one

I need you, girl
I couldn't live a day without you


Well, I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make me feel inside
Though the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried


I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
I need you


Well, I sang the words and realized
It had all been said before
So I tried a different rhyme that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again

This is it
Here I stand
In the light of the world
Love is grand
And this love
I can feel
And I know
Yes, for sure
It is real

And it seems as though
I've seen your face a thousand times
And you know
That you've seen my face before
And you said that you don't want me to come around
But many times
I'm gonna do it to this love
Ooh yeah


I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please, baby, I'm trustin'


This is it
Here I stand
With you
I've got the world in my hands
And this love
That I feel
Yes, I know
That's for sure
This is real

This is it, here I stand 
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
And this love, I can feel
And I know yes for sure, it is real
Innocent man
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way


Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt, we'll be a crutch
When there's thirst, we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care, we love
Enough to share 

Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way


In despair, we'll be the hope 
And the prayer that frees the soul 
We'll be there to share each lonely road 
Because we love, I know 
We care enough, yeah 


Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way


Just a little time is all it takes 
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see 
Love is all we need 


Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
 But we still can change some things today
In our small way
 Ooh
 Ooh



One, two, three


Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way


Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share 

Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day 
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way


In despair we'll be the hope 
And the prayer that frees the soul 
We'll be there to share each lonely road 
Because we love, I know 
We care enough 


Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day 
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way


Just a little time is all it takes

What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need 


Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

In the game of love
You either win or lose
But you have to face the truth
When you play the game of love 
In the game of love 
There's a chance you have to take 
If you think your heart should break 
When you play the game of love 


Oh, it is amazing, how close to you I feel
Sometimes I wonder, I wonder if it's real
Could we be lovers or just the best of friends 
Or is this just a story that's coming to an end 

In the game of love 
You either win or lose 
But you have to face the truth 
When you play the Game of Love
In the game of love 
There's a chance you have to take 
If you think your heart should break 
When you play the game of love 


If I had the power, I would reach into your mind
And try to find the answers, that your heart could never hide
You see but I'm only human, I must have fallen for your spell
But baby for the future, I guess only time will tell
Oh, no no

If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you, but still you say it ain't cool


If there's somebody else 
And he, and he says he'll treat you well 
And he's buying diamonds and pearls 
And he's taking you all across the world 

So why ain't you feelin' me 
She's invincible
I can't do anything
She's invincible
Even when I beg and plead
She's invincible
Girl won't give in to me
She's in-, she's invincible


Well, well, see
Well, well
Come on now, oh


Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me, how does it seem that you ain't checking for me 
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream


And if there's somebody else 
And he, he says he'll treat you well 
And he's buying diamonds and pearls 
And he's taking you all across the world 
None
Merry Christmas and a happy new year

Wow! Mommy's kissing Santa Claus!


I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus 
Underneath the mistletoe last night
She didn't see me creep
Down the stairs to have a peep
She thought that I was tucked up
In my bedroom, fast asleep


Then I saw mommy tickle, tickle 
Underneath his beard so snowy white
Oh, what a laugh it would have been
If Daddy had only seen
Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night


He saw mommy kissing 
I did! I really did see mommy kissing Santa Claus
And I'm gonna tell my dad

There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed

Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see

To be the stranger in your life

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling


I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes 
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light

And a coffin that lay open
Where a restless soul has spoken


I'm gonna be
Exactly what you've come to see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
None

I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery


There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air 
'Cause they're hiding everywhere




Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is it scary for you, baby

You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby

The joy you bring to me each day
Makes loneliness seem far away
It all begins and ends with love


Each time you're near I feel so good
I'm touching stars I never could
It all begins and ends with love


Yes, it does, baby, yeah
An old man smiles at children's songs
You and me singing right along
Reaching out tuning in, tuning in, yeah
Listen to the world begin
Listen to the world begin


Of all the things I've ever done
Just knowin' you is number one
It all begins and ends with love


Ooh baby
Look at me, look at me
Me and you
Together we can prove it's true
It all begins and ends with love
Baby, baby, baby
It all begins and ends...

Never look up, only look one time
Never hook up, only sups, heys, and hi s
Been in back my bag like the fries are the bottom
Never get past this road block in my life
Gettin the courage to say somethin was on me
Chill with guys and gals and they said look homie
Go use this chance at this dance to try to do something
Create the will to go talk, no one will do if for me
Uhn, mood  ready set just go over and do it slowly
Strike up a convo dont wanna leave here lonely
Thinkin of witty moves and charms to us  on her
She is prize and my  yes needin a trophy
Movin so nervously, she turned and approached me
Time for talents, gotta clutch like Kobe
Gettinn ready to ask her, I leaned in so closely
All of sudden she turned and then told me-




I woke up, must ve been the shock that awoke me
I look up, Im still starin at the wall
I sit up, I hear the clock in the nosebleeds
I stand up, and shes sittin in the hall
I woke up, must ve been the shock that awoke me
I look up, Im still starin at the wall
I sit up, I hear the clock in the nosebleeds
I stand up, no ones sittin in the hall
RIght now, right now
I go, to go pick up the phone
One bar in the phone, one scar in the bones
Feel it ailing my skeleton, now my feet wanna roam
Sittin in the next room, there she is roun  a dome
Keep befriendin the known, one lil sentence Im gone
I know, I keep settin her up on throne
But a queen needs a king, right now the queens alone
Ive shone, I can't accomplish anything
Continuous thoughts binded by a mental ring
In the front of the mind, but I keep belittling
Emotes on steady cookin, they still is sizzling yeah
Is sizzling yeah
Tried another route but I keep ending up here
Needin a reunion see me out it Ma Dear
Try have her number by the end of the year
Then she called me over and said this in my ear
None
So glad, so glad, so glad, so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby; thank you, baby; thank you, baby
Back where I belong


Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected
So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said "Darling, won't you please"
I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby

Thank you, baby; thank you, baby
Back where I belong
It's great to be here, great to be here, oooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong, woo


Adventure grabbed my heart
And took me away from you, honey
I met all kinds of pretty girls
In every town that I passed through
But that fiery senorita
Burned me down in Mexico
And I got kisses cold as ice
From my Alaskan Eskimo
I feel guilty and ashamed
But I'm gonna say it just the same, baby


Thank you, baby; thank you, baby, yeah
Back where I belong
It's great to be here, great to be here , oooh
It's great to be here in your arms


Gotta get this se orita
She gave me I'll just si ya!
While kissing in the igloo
My Eskimo said no no!

So glad , so glad , so glad
To be back in your arms



To be back in your arms
So glad , so glad , so glad
To be back in your arms
Thank you, baby 
Thank you, baby
Be back where I belong


Oh, I went out to do my thing
And I was totally rejected
I put you down for love unknown
But it wasn't what I expected
So frightened and confused
I came running back to you
I got right down on my knees
And said "Darling, won't you please
I don't know why you did it
But I'm not too proud to admit it, baby"


Thank you, baby
Thank you, baby
Back where I belong
It's great to be here , ooh-ooh
It's great to be here in your arms
Back where I belong

Don't tell me you want out of this
Don't say it's time for us to quit
Don't say goodbye, this can't be it
Baby, please, 'cause it's not worth it


Baby, we wanted too much to just walk out on each other
I just, I just think we really need to think about it before we just leave
It's just not worth it
It's not worth the pain
It's not worth the waiting
It's not worth it to walk away
It's not worth it, think about it...


You came into my life
And it's so funny how you made everything right
And now you're sayin' to me something ain't right
What did I do  Did I hurt you 
Baby, can you tell me how to dry your eyes 
But let me say, I never meant to make you cry
If anything, I meant to be right by your side
How did I go wrong 
When my love is strong and all it ever wanted was you

It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love



You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause


No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again


It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry







In this automatic age
We shop through the Yellow Page
Gone is the corner store
There's a supermarket there for you 
People give way to change
But feelings remain the same

And it's too late, too late to change the time
Well, it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
But it's no too late to change your mind


It's a new day, a new age
A photograph just taken is ready one minute later
Cars are bigger and better
But the manufacturer's satisfied never
In a world full of crime
I can't let you take that ride


And it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
And it's too late, too late to change the time
But it's not too late to change your mind, no, no

I was the loser Oceans apart day after day
And I slowly go insane
I hear your voice on the line
But it doesn't stop the pain
If I see you next to never
How can we say forever

Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you

I took for granted, all the times
That I thought would last somehow
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears
But I can't get near you now
Oh, can't you see it baby
You've got me going crazy

Wherever you do
Whatever you say
I will be right here waiting for you
Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks
I will be right here waiting for you
One little kiss
Led to another and another and another
Then, ooh, I wanted you
And now I feel those good vibrations
Deep inside my soul
Telling me that you're my goal


But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't turn away
Open your heart, let me stay
And I will find a way


Oh, trying to get to you
Is like trying to get a little cat down from the top of a tree
You're scared of me
But believe my ladder to love
Is strong and it will never break
Your little heart will be safe


But if I'm stepping out of line
If my words don't seem to rhyme
It's because I'm falling head over heels in love with you
Darling, please don't be afraid
Open your heart and let me stay
And I will find a way

Nation to nation
All the world must come together
Face the problems that we see
Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last

Go with it, go with it, HOO

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong 
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

People have misunderstandings
Of what life is all about
They put values in the wrong things
And in happiness they lose out
'Cause being happy is a feeling
This is all a frame of mind
And every moment you feel sad and blue
You could be having a real good time
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy 
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad 
If you just try it, feel better
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy 
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad 
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Do it, do it, do it, do it
Do it, hmm
There is no sense in worrying
'Cause that won't solve a thing
Chances are what's ever worrying you
Is not as bad as it seems
Being down won't last forever
'Cause nothing really stays the same
You will have a bright tomorrow
There's always sunshine after rain
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy 
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad 
If you just try it, I know you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy and be happy 
Why don't you jump for joy and be glad 
If you just try it, I know you'll like it
And have the best time you've ever had

C'mon, yeah, c'mon, yeah, yeah

Why don't you jump for joy 
Why don't you jump for joy 
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy 
Why don't you jump for joy 
If you just try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy 
Why don't you jump for joy 
Try it, I'm sure you'll like it
And have the best time you ever had
Why don't you jump for joy 
Why don't you jump for joy 
Would you try it  I'm sure you'll like it 
And have the best time you ever had
C'mon, c'mon, yeah, yeah
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby
Yeah
Why don't you jump for joy  Yeah, yeah

Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away


I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, can no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me


Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it is all I need, it is all I need


Since the day I have been loving you
I can't catch a cold, I can't catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need


Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need

It's so poor, boy, to hurt his girl
And to watch her walk away cryin  
When all along, you know he's wrong
To be so hard on a girl that's tryin  
I was so unkind to hurt you so
Goin' out of my mind, I just gotta let you know, yeah


Baby, I can't let you go
I realize I hurt you so
Our love surely can be mended
It's just a little misunderstanding


I remember you said you would always care
Until death should we will part 
And it surely must be my destiny
To die one day after a broken heart 
So before I become a wandering rover
Let's get together and talk things over

You and me, we've traded hearts
I guess that's how it always starts out
And then I guess it always ends
Look at us now, sayin'


I don't think that you and me can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing has to just end


And if we could have loved enough
We would have handled when it got rough
But one of us let go too soon
So here we are 
Now sayin'

I don't think that you and me can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing has to just end



It's funny how when love has gone
There's only one left holding on
When someone's always hurtin' more
Still lonely for the other
Sayin'


I don't think that you and me can just be friends
I don't ever wanna feel so much again
Feel again
Unless it's you  again



I guess that's how it always starts out
And then I guess it always ends
Look at us  now  sayin'


I don't think that you and me can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing has to just end 

Yeah, yeah, yeah
Aaow, oh girl, yeah
Me and you, girl
C'mon baby, Girl girl, oh


I watched you on the floor
Cheek to cheek
She's getting to you
You didn't see, her eyes on me, no
She looked right through you
 Before you make
 Remember
That looks can fool you, babe 
There's something I would sure appreciate



Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares

Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there

If they ask her
Tell 'em that we're just good friends
Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!

Dah! Chika-chika-chika-ah!
Just good friends
Ah! Chika-chika-ah! Ooo

Just good friends


You better take advice
Never trust first impressions
I tried to hide this affair
From their suspicions
So even if she's asking you to stay
You better know where you stand


Baby loves me, but she never shows she cares

Baby loves me, no, she acts like I'm not there

Cause what you got they'll make you lose
And then turn around and step in your shoes
I say they'll turn around
And step in your shoes
Like the day I stood there numb
Watchin' my friend walk away
With my love on his arm
And all he left me was
The memory of the moment when he said
"I'm sorry for what I have to do
But you see I love her just as much as you"

Keep an eye
Keep an eye

On your close friend

The devil's workshop is a busy place
On top of evil he puts an innocent face
Oh, on top of evil he puts an innocent face
Cause like a spider only twice as smart

Kindness was the thread
He used to weave my world apart
It used to be three of us seen all over town
Now there's only two
Someone's missing guess who
Ooh yeah, baby, ooh yeah
She s the one 
She s the one 
So I don t need a friend like you messing with my baby s mind
Let me give you some advice before you step out of line

You better, keep off the grass!  
Walk on past don t look back, no no 
You better keep off the grass! 
Walk on past don t look back.  
I know you re looking for some property to lay your hands upon
Mine is not for sale so you better move on
She s mine 
She s mine, mine, mine, mine, mine

She s the one that swept me off my feet
She s the one that made my life complete
You look just like a snake with your sneaky face
When you walked through the door of our life 

You better keep off the grass 
Walk on past don t look back
Yeah, yeah baby
You better keep off the grass 
Walk on past don t look back
No, no. Yeah, yeah

Keep on dancing

Dancing, yeah

'Cause there's nothing else to do

It makes you feel good too


B-boy, where the fuck you at 
I been looking for your ass since a quarter past
Hot peas and butter, baby, come and get your supper
Before I make you suffer, that's when you had enough-a
Can I get hot when you hit the jackpot
Surely I can if you the man
I get loose and produce large amounts of juice
Can you get used to that or do you need a boost of energy
To enter me and get it on
You're getting warm
I can feel you getting closer
Now baby, down this Mimosa
You better believe it's time to give a toast to
The woman of the decade, too bad to be played
Get vexed and I'm bound to throw shade
All over your body
Whose body  Your body
I can rock a party like nobody
Leaving time to take home the loot
Choosy about who I let knock my boot
Now let me take sight to you loving the Lyte
Life ain't all that unless you're doing it right


Keep on, keep keepin' on
'Cause you came and you changed my world
Your love's so brand new
Keep on keep keepin' on
Doin' it right, right, right

Keep the faith
Don't let nobody take you down
Just keep your eyes on the prize
And your feet flat on the ground
Keep the faith
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself no matter what it's gon' take
You can be a winner, but you gotta keep the faith
Keep the faith

Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try

You gotta know when it's good to go 
To get your dr ams up off the ground 
Keep th  faith , brother, yeah
'Cause it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out


I told my brother how to do the thing right
Lift up your head and show the world you got pride
Go for what you want, don't let 'em get in your way
You could be a winner, but you got to keep the faith
If you called out loud
Would it get inside
Through the heart of your surrender
To your alibis 
And you can say the words
Like you understand
But the power's in believing
Give yourself a chance


Because you can
Climb the highest mountain
Swim the deepest sea, hee
All you need is the will to want it
And a, little self-esteem

So keep the faith
Don't let nobody turn you 'round
You got to know when it's good to go
To get your dreams up off of the ground
Keep the faith, baby, yeah
Because it's just a matter of time
Before your confidence will win out
Believe in yourself
No matter what it's gonna take
You can be a winner
But you got to keep the faith
Gon' keep it, brother
You got it


And when ya think of trust
Does it lead you home
To a place that you only dream of
When you're all alone 
And you can go by the feel
'Stead of circumstance
But the power's in believing
So give yourself a chance


I know that you can
Sail across the water
Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you'll only try

Keep the faith
Don't let nobody take you down
You got to know when it's good to go
And get your dreams up off the ground
So keep the faith, ah

Before your confidence will win out

You can be a winner, but you gotta keep the faith
Ah, go and keep it, brother, you got it

Float across the sky, high
Any road that you take will get you there
If you only try


So keep the faith 
Don't let nobody turn you 'round

She's lookin' for a job and to find a place to stay
She's lookin' for the hope in the empty promisin'
She's workin' two jobs, keepin' alive
She works in a restaurant night and day
She waits her life away
She wipes the tears away


She cries inside every time she feels this way
And she's dyin' inside every time her baby cries, no

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly

Keepin' your head up to the sky
Or we can just rise up, tell me now
Give me your wings so we can fly


We're killin' up the life in the birds and the trees
And we're suckin' up the air in the earth from under me 
I can't even breathe 
I can't even see 
Keep your head up, don't give up today
How long can we wait 
I wish that love would come today


All you need is love
Tell you I know it's coming soon
And all you need is just a moment, want it to
Keep your head up


Keepin' your head up to the sky
Keepin' your mind on stayin' alive
Give me your wings so we can fly
Fly away, fly away, fly away 
Keepin' your head up to the sky

Bitch, where you when I was walkin' 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'

When you got the yams 
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street

I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter 
What the fuck happened  
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell 
Something's in the water 
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin' 
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah

None
Yeah, uh, uh, look


Leave me alone, I been sick of the phony
Say that I'm bogus but don't really know me
Don't need a friend, no I don't need a homie
Me and myself and my music 
Know what I want, they could never control me
And if they try I'ma 
Seeing them changing, they doing it slowly
They wanna block out my shot like a goalie
They try to troll me, I'm doing the same
Tired of acting and all of the games
I see the way that they play with my pain
I don't see losses, I'm thinking in gains
Through with the lames that are trying to bash
Fuck all the haters, I'm making it last
I see the greatness that  my path
I know that they're scared and they fearing the wrath
Chatting and saying that I'm busy  playing
They trying to play like the kid ain't amazing
I'm busy loving, evolving, creating
And like we were cousins, there's people relating
Only my dreams is what I'm busy chasing
History been what I'm thinking of making
I know that most of you had me mistaken
My spirit's  it's never breaking
Shaking the pressure away on the daily
And I'm getting tired but I'm never lazy
Mental fatigue has been stressing me lately
Still I'ma shine and an emperor made me
This shady is making me crazy for real
Step in the grain and I'm chasing the thrills
Niggas can hate me, I'm taking the bills
I'm patiently waiting like 50 for mills
I feel like I wanna run for the hills
Feel like a snap I'm taking a still
There's been a way 'cause I know that I will
And fuck what you say, I'm aware of the skill
Feeling it's war, some will adore
Seen it before so I won't ignore
Open it up like a knock at a door
I know it's the point like I'm trying to score
Lyrics are life as they from the core
I put in work like I'm done with a tour
Once from the bottom, I'm taking the floor
Wait til you see what I carry in store
Y'all are a bore,  striking
Here to enlighten, I had the wisest
Still I'm the one that the others despising
Is it the beats or the bars that I'm writing
Still I'm remembered like I was a Titan
Know that I am 'cause I'm seeing them biting
Heavy with lyrics, they think I'm a lion
It comes from the spirit, it's why I'm surviving
Igniting the fire I hold in my soul
Making it diamond with all of this coal
Pressure is nothing but making a mold
My pleasure will come from the victory stroll

Uh

 lifeNoneOh-Ohhh
Tear me apart
Break my heart
Let me in this wonderland with you

Your desire warms my heart
I loved you from the moment of your sigh
She said she wanna fall in love
She said she wanna give it up
Oh, she said wanna turn my life all around
She said she wanna play the game
I love it when your say my name
I love it when you say you want me around

I wanna fall, wanna fall in love with you
Oooh, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you
Just let me fall with you
Girl, just let me fall, let me fall with you
Please, just let me fall, let me fall in love with you

Now I'm here with you, the sun comes through
The moon is watching us, me and you
The sun is going down
The rain comes down
The rain comes down
And the wind is blowing us
And it's soothe

Yea yea yea!
Oh girl
I remember you Calling, saying
That things were through with us
I have a hard time feeling within
Just started moving on
Got back my feeling chilling
Started chilling getting back with it


Now I seem to be everywhere lately
Too much to be coincidental
Why you want to lead me on
I am not the one you want
So girl do not keep me hanging
You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go

Ooh yeah
When we started dating making
Moves on the single scene
Never seen you so jealous
Telling all the other girls that you are still with me
You may think it is funny honey
I am not laughing
You know what I think about it




You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let go
Heart always ringing my phone
Goodbye do not mean hello
Love, you leave me alone
You would not! You would not let me let go

You would not let me let go
Got me thinking it is on
Girl you know that you are wrong
You would not, you would not let me let goIntro: Busta Rhymes

Hey, yo, Kina, take it away

Sittin , hoping, wishing , dreaming
Of those things that we'd be doing
Only if you give me a chance
Every time I sync, we're moving
You slow down and stop my grooving
Baby won't you let go and dance, oh, oh baby

Hey, yo, Nicci, come on

Baby can't you see it's only you
And only you that's just for me
Is it fiction or truth, hey
Love is high and love goes slow
Is this the way my story goes
Don't just stay and just let it flow
Let s go back, 
Let s go back  relive the story about day one 
Let s go back  relive the story about day one

Let s go back relive the story about day one
When you first kissed my lips that s when my life begun
I thought I knew love before but I was only having fun
As we re turning the pages of time your love faded girl not mine

Let s go back  relive the story about day one 
Let s go back  to the first chapter where our love begun

People say look to tomorrow but I can t even live today
Not unless you say that you love me I d rather stay in yesterday
No temptation no duplication to keep me away

Let s go back relive the story about day one 
Let s go back to the first chapter when our love begun

We got to change the plot of Chapter 2
You can live without me I can t live without you
Move on to Chapter 3 when you are next to me where you re supposed to be
Let s go back to relive the story about day one

Let s go back to relive the story about day one 
Let s go back to relive the story about day one 
Let s go back relive the story about day one

Let s go back to relive the story about day one 
To my unborn child 
To my unborn child
In case I don t make it
Just remember, Daddy loves you


Now ever since my birth, I've been cursed, since I'm born to wile
In case I never get to holla at my unborn child
Many things learned in prison, blessed and still livin'
Tryna earn every penny that I'm gettin'
I'm reminiscin' to the beginnin' of my mission
When I was conceived and came to be in this position
My mama was a Panther, loud single parent, but she proud
When she witnessed baby boy rip a crowd
Went to school, but I dropped out and left the house
 Cause my mama say I'm good for nothin', so I'm out
Since I only got one life to live, God forgive me for my sins
Let me make it and I'll never steal again or deal again
My only friend is my misery
Wantin' revenge for the agony they did to me
See, my life ain't promised, but it's sure gettin' better
Hope you understand my love letter, to my unborn child

I'm writing you a letter
This is to my unborn child
Wanna let you know I love you
If you didn't know I feel this way
 Cause I think about you every day
I have so much to say


Seems so complicated to escape fate
And you can never understand 'til we trade places
Tell the world I feel guilty for bein' anxious
Ain't no way in hell that I could ever be a rapist
It's hard to face this cold world on a good day
When will they let the little kids in the hood play 
I got shot five times, but I'm still breathin'
Living proof there's a God if you need a reason
Can I believe in my own fate 
Will I raise my kids in the right or the wrong way 
Dear Mama, I'm a man now
I wanna make it on my own, not a handout
Make way for a whirlwind prophesized
I wanna go in peace when I gotta die
On these cold streets, ain't no love, no mercy and no friends
In case you never see my face again, to my unborn child

Little bitty pretty one

I've been watching you grow

Little bitty pretty one

Come on, come on

Come on

I can tell you a story
That happened a long time ago
Little bitty pretty one
I've been watching you grow
I watch the snowflakes fall
Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is


Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve


I hear the Christmas bells

The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
None
Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon


A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair


Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain
I want the world
The whole wide world
To stop and listen to me
If we're going to stick together
We've got to be a family
This love
Love
Love
Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know

By living together
'Cause if this world
Is gonna be our home
We've got to make it strong
By living together
Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Give me peace
Give me sweet, sweet peace
So I can do my thing
I don't want no wars to hurt me
'Cause hurt is all it brings
Lets take the time
To check it on out
And learn what's right and wrong
Someday we can tell our children
That all the wars are gone
Love, love, love
Have yourself a good, good time
But don't you know
It's getting late

Girl, your love, I can't explain what it does to me
Every moment is like heaven
Your eyes open's my soul, giving me reason for living
Without you, I don't know what I'll do
Being alone, I cannot bare, living a world without an angel to hold
I can't imagine
That's why each day
I'm living to love you
Each day, I'm living, living for the love of you
With each step I take
I pray you'll be there
If I got that, then I got you
That's why I'm living to love you, 
How did it get this way 
It's plain to see; only true love delivers such feelings as these
Sweet kisses each moment we're together, enlightens my soul, with peace, and understanding
Making it clear as day, I can live, but if living is without you
I knew if you were gone, I probably couldn't breathe
That's why, each day, I'm living to love you
Each day, I'm living, living for the love of you
With each step I take
I pray you'll be there
If I got that, then I got you
That's why I'm living to love you, 

No one  no one will ever take the place of loving me
Because it's so real, honest, true and worth living for, evening dying for

With every breathe I take, it's for you
Emotions running deep, I'm ready to settle down
With all my heart, I'm living to love youNoneNone
Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'

Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause every day that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry


Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'

I wrote my first bars in the car with Stacy
How bizarre, my battle scars at large would lace me
Big marbles, nigga
I lead this new generation, boy, don't argue with us
Marvelous beat selectors, authors, and novel spitters
And it's all for the literature
And it's all for the hideous, the nastiest flows, the Chlamydia, uh
I ain't afraid to say I need you, ah, yeah 
I promise I'd never leave you, ah, yeah
My life is like twelve open mics of hopeless notes I write
For sure, my folks unite soon as the flow get nice
The poltergeist that scare emcees, my prototype for every
My share of deeds and R.I.P.s
You know my type of style is like my everything
Apparently, my appetite stay famished
Bite no hand that feed
The culture vulture die and bleed
My focus hold these thoughts and dreams
Control this pen 
Boldest lines of rhymes and things
Devote my time and mind it seems
I'm 'posed to shine, remind I'm king
Provoke the blind and bomb the fiends
The pros, the cons, the diamond rings
I'm full with time but I'ma bring
The soul divine and cross between
What's yours and mines, the gold, the green
The ropes that show just what it mean
Then grab Shakur right by the wing
And fly before my vocals 
For hip-hop, look at my Ziploc
Bag full of goodies, you Chris Rock
Hit the Pookie and pit stops
Since tube socks, baby, you a hell of a drug
Just look over your shoulders when they fuck you over, it's love
I know ya 
Ohhhh oooh sending it out a love call 
Sending out a love call 
  sending out a love call
Sending out a love call yeah yeah yeah 
Anybody here, anybody in this world
Can tell a lonely boy where he can find a lonely girl
Ohhhh I've searched and I've searched every when and where

But no one  seems to care
Just to hug or kiss or be in your arms
Now I can't even, no no no
Ohhhh oooh sending it out a love call 
Sending out a love call 


Ohhhh oooh sending it out a love call 
We've got a love call 
Like the birds in the trees I can sing a sweet melody
Sending out a love call  
But love keeps playing tricks on me
Love keeps playing hide and seek

But oh love  where can you be
I've been searching for you now every place
Come on out now and show your face
Last night, night before 25 kisses or more
Stand out here when the love comes in hit him in the head
With a rolling
You're the one, I've been searching for
Like a special treat, in a candy store
I sample every kind, of flavors I can find
Strawberry, butterscotch, pineapple, lemon lime
I had to shop around to find out

 Love comes in different flavors
 I like the kind you make girl
 Love comes in different flavors
 Just wrap it up, I'll take it

Others guys like your flavors too
You say you like mine
So it's me and you
I'm gonna hang a sign, down at the candy store
All sold out, there ain't no more
I like to, thank you folks for the recipe

 Love comes in different flavors
 I like the kind you make girl
 Love comes in different flavors


Love comes in flavors, made for everyone
All I tasted, were a lot of fun

I remember how it used to be
When your every thought was loving me
Yesterday
Now you're acting like you never cared 
When I need you girl you're never there
It's a shame


My heart wants me to stay 
But my pride keeps telling
My feet to walk away

Love don't wanna leave
That girl is walking out the door
Walking out with me
Why can't you want this anymore 
 Can't you see
 Love don't wanna leave


Dreaming dreams and
Wishing on the moon 
Everything is Sunday afternoon 
So in love
Finding love, get clovers in the grass 
Who would ever think it wouldn't last 
Well, look at us 


Monday morning came too soon 
Can't believe it's over
After all that we've been through


Love don't wanna leave
That girl is walking out the door
Walking out with me
Why can't you want this anymore 
 Can't you see
 Love don't wanna leave, no no

Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone


You persuaded me to love you and I did
But instead of tenderness, I found heartache, instead
Into your arms, I fell, so unaware
Of the loneliness that was waiting there


You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me


Love is here
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone
You made me love you
And, oh, my darling, now, you're gone


You said loving you would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came into my heart
You turned and you walked, just walked away

Ooh!

Why don't you believe me
When I say that I love you 

You wear the face that tells me
You think my loving ain't true

You're my desire, I get higher
Every time I speak your name
All I do 
And the way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I'm crazy 'bout you


Now the first time that I saw you walkin' down the street so pretty
Go on with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love when it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's drivin' me insane

Love, love scenes, love scenes



You are a part of my life I needed so bad
And I'd never forget the good times we had
Like we starred in a movie, the life that we said
Might think of the heart, and you're what it said


Love scenes, ooh ooh
That was yesterday, you weren't thinkin' 'bout today
Ooh girl


All the tears you cry, which is part of the act
As the days go by, I know it's a fact
And now I can see
What happened to you and me


Hey, love scenes, ooh ooh
That was yesterday, you weren't thinkin' 'bout today
Ooh girl
Ooh baby, ooh baby 
Love scenes, ooh ooh
That was yesterday, you weren't thinkin' 'bout today

Ooh baby, ooh baby
Ah I feel a pounding in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feel sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad

I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love, I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see 
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me 
Where's the tenderness to comfort me 

Everytime some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart feels sad 'cause Love's Gone Bad
Love's Gone Bad, heart feels sad

Ooh, Black cruel signing up above
It's a sign I live my life without love
Signs on the man, slime's on the sea
Signs everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And if the world baby nothing's right
Since you've been gone baby
Can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool of me
Heart feel sad, Love's Gone Bad

This is just a little love song
From me to you
I just wanna say I thank you
For loving me like you do
It's a happy "You're the one" song
Just too good to be true
Gonna dedicate this love song, this love song to you


Yesterday, my empty heart had nothing to do
But sit alone, and sing me the blues
Who'd ever think, I'd change my tune
Well, it was easy when I'm with you


I feel the rhythm of a love song
Playing all day long
So take my hand, and we will dance on
While the band plays on
Hey!


Yesterday, my lonely heart had nothing to do
But sit alone, and sing me the blues
Who'd ever think, I'd change my tune
Well it was easy, when I'm with you
Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh luscious child what ya doing to me just drives me wild
Do you know how long I ve waited for someone
Who could make me feel just the way I m feeling now 

Child, I can t help but smile

At the magic in your fingers making music flow

Each fingertip taking you on a love trip 

Each fingertip taking me on a love trip

Ooh, baby, baby
Ooh luscious child what ya doing to me just drives me wild
Never thought someone would love me like you do
Who could turn me on every day and night time too

Child, I can t help but smile

At the magic in your fingers making music flow
Her tender touch taking you each place you want to go

Each fingertip taking you on a love trip

If there is one thing I really ever want to do
Is always making life a little easier for you

I ll do your daily chores to get you through the day
And I ll replace your stove with restaurants and movie shows
In always making life a little easier for you

So don t you worry your pretty little head
See if I can let me take us through  
And if there s one thing I really ever want to do
Is always making life a little easier for you

To see you lift a finger makes me nervous
And I don t want my baby abused
So darling I ll remain at your service 
In always making life a little easier for you

So don t you worry your pretty little head
See if I can let me take us through 
And if there s one thing I really ever want to do
Is always making life a little easier for you  

If it rains on your parade I ll take you through the storm 
Now when the world treats you cold 

Sunday morning I heard mama pray
From a room I heard her say
"Good Lord help my son find his way"
"Lord he's just a country boy"
"He thinks the world is great big toy"
There ain't nothin' he can't do
If he wants to

He got himself a part time job
Saved his money and bought him a guitar
Played from sun up to sundown, hey, hey, hey

 Go to schoool no more
Don't do his household chores
But I must admit, the neighbors dig his sound
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

 Got some big ideas
He's talkin' 'bout leavin' here
Going to a place called New York City
And here's what he told me


Mama, I gotta brand new thing, don't say no
Let me go
Mama,  I got a brand new thing, don't say no
Let me go

You send cold chills up and down my spine
We kiss for thrills, then you draw the line
Oh baby 
'Cause your mama told you that love ain't right
But don't you know good lovin' is the spice of life, yeah

My best friend told me he d help me
With a little girl s love
I don t know what I searched before
If I had nerve enough

He say he d say those words for me
I was much too shy
I never thought my best friend
Would come with his reply
Guess who s making whoopee with your girlfriend
Those seven words just drove me out of my mind
Guess who s making whoopee with your girlfriend
You said what mine is yours and yours is all mine

Let me thank you now my friend
I was speaking for myself
I saw that little girl today
And told her how I felt

She said she heard those words before
But wished they came from me
Do I have to tell you what

Those seven words just mean you wasting your time

Gonna make a difference, gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know


I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change


I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home, not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Hey

Lord, this wind is blowin' my mind

With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind pretending not to know their needs 

A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
Because they got no place to go
And so I want you to know

If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana


I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone 
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

Got me six feet deep in the soil
No more chasing the ol' tin foil
Black tar filling up my lungs
Vinegar taste on the tip of my tongue
Pin drop pupils my whites turn red
My eyes roll into the back of my head
Every time I start to overheat
Till I can t get up outa my seat


I get much higher
Escaping my fear here
I can't believe how far I run
I cannot tell if that's me in the mirror
I never would ve guessed that I look so dumb

When I see my friends shoot up
They nod out g tting high as fuck
Nowadays when they come down lately
I turn the heater up then I crank the AC
Every time they get up sick
Goddam baby that's hard to kid
My buddy got the gangrene-prick
Don't lose your arm it won't grow back kid


You get much higher
Escaping your fear here
I can't believe how far you'd run
I cannot tell if that's you in the mirror
I never would've guessed that you look so dumb


Every time I itch my skin it feels too good to believe
And every time you smile I can see your missing teeth
It s an ugly love affair
The most twisted I ve seen
But you can't escape it s a disease


You get much higher
Escaping your fear here
I can't believe how far you'd run
I cannot tell if that's you in the mirror
I never would ve guessed that you look so dumb

In my veins, I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Do you care 
Have you a part 
In the deepest emotions of my own heart


I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
See the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know


I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana

Ik ga een verandering maken
Voor   n keer in mijn leven
Het gaat heel goed voelen
Ga een verandering maken
Ga het goed maken
Toen ik de kraag van mijn favoriete jas omdraaide
Deze wind blaast door mijn hoofd
Ik zie de kinderen, met niet genoeg te eten
Wie ben ik om blind te zijn, niet zien of ze iets nodig hebben
Een zomer minachting, een kapotte fles
En de ziel van een mens
Ze volgen elkaar op de wind, je weet wel
Omdat ze nergens heen kunnen
Daarom wil ik dat je het weet


Ik begin met de man in de spiegel
Ik vraag om zijn wegen te veranderen
En geen bericht had duidelijker kunnen zijn
Als je de wereld een betere plek wilt maken
Kijk eens naar jezelf en maak een verandering


Ik ben een slachtoffer geweest van een ego stische vorm van liefde
Het is tijd om te realiseren
Er zijn mensen zonder huis
Geen nikkel om te lenen
Kan het echt waar zijn dat ik doe alsof ze niet alleen zijn
Een wilg diep getekend met littekens, iemand zijn gebroken hart
En een uitgewassen droom
Ze volgen de patroon van de wind, je ziet het
Omdat ze geen plek hebben om te zijn
Dat is waarom ik met mij start

I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs

A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know

Nanana, nanana, nana, nana, uh-huh


I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone 


A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream

They follow the pattern of the wind you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me

I'm looking right up to the sky and now I m feeling energy
I m thinking bout the people that were looking back and telling me
I m never gonna make it, never gonna mount to nothing
Now I'm looking down at them because my life is meaning something
I wish that I could sing to try and say how I feel
But sometimes my tone of voice has these feelings it conceals
I wish that i could me the man that you want me to be
But ive gotta go and be the man that i need myself to be
Because Ive got so many friends that are looking out for me
And man im making all this music thats just got me feeling free
Im thinking bout these songs and they always made me feel so special
I just knew that they were right when they all said I had potential
And I'm glad they were right, because now ive got a reason to be sleeping at night
I ve got a vision, got a goal, a new purpose in life, because that man in the mirrors making everything alright

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change


So now Im looking up because I ve got a clearer vision
On a mission in my life go and end all the division
Television tellings us that the whole world is turning rough
But there's no need afraid we just need to be standing tough
Life is just a series of trials and tests, and bets so let's be the best set of people living yet
We ve gotta be the generation to go make a difference, don't let your life just be another one of insignificance
Cuz The world has a history of making mistakes
Never thinking of the difference that music can make
Look at Michael's legacy and all the things he left behind
And All the people he s affected only happiness in mind
Go find yourself in your very own reflection
Because one day you can tell that you ll be staring at perfection
Don't be stressing, dont be hating, cuz you know they re underrating
Just keep looking in the mirror  then you know you can be stating
That I m


I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
